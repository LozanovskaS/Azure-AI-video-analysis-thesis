[Music]
[Applause]
D's already mentioned the tension
actually United cup I was talking to
wiim foret eager's coach because she
sent off a fair few rackets on a hot day
there but only changed the tension by
half a kilo so went from 25.5 to
26 and just the fact that she can even
feel that kind of
difference good
4 but the biggest difference for Raku
today is her first two matches she's
played opponents who have given her a
lot they've given her a lot of unforced
errors to work with the first round
against alexandraa plays a bit hit and
miss and anisim overa it was 44 unforced
erors from her in that second round
she's not going to get that
today holds to love in this opening
[Applause]
game we touched on Le goon's newly
appointed appointed coach Wim
foret started with him in October last
year and
he's had quite the experience worked
with former world number one's Victoria
as a ranker Kim kers Angeli K Naomi
Osaka what do you think he can bring
to's game yeah he's been repping out top
players don't worry about wh um no I
think he's a great manager as well he
manages the team that's what he he's
always has done his approaches to come
in and get everyone on the same
page and really I think what he's trying
to do with her game in this season is to
stop her from trying to go for power
against the big hitters if you think
back to this time last year she lost to
Lyon nosov
so they lost to Linda no last year but
also the 2022 semi-final loss to
Danielle Collins Shan has this habit
when she's under pressure against
someone who's hitting it huge to try
and stay at their level to try and outow
them and so whims approach has been
actually you're a great mover you can
step back
and just use the shape that shantex got
on the on the forehand anyway lean into
her strengths a bit
more so that's a good start here from
shant yet to drop a
point for
well that will help set us the nerves
for
ranu
15 just waiting for that right
opportunity likes to dictate as well
and that would certainly help with the
confidence
154 and they just confirmation of how
much rotation shant gets on that
forehand side huge huge difference in
the Top Spin
so in regards to that top swing once
that ball hits the ground it's getting
up above ranu shoulders is that where it
will hurt her yeah definitely
especially on the backand side I think
the forehand Emma can come over the top
of the ball really well
face two break points ranu back to juice
yes
advantage
there's that double fault that we've
seen ranu throw in in our previous two
matches yeah coach Nick Cav in the black
cap
and then utaka Nakamura the fitness
trainer new addition to the team in the
Red Cap the double fults in the first
round started off as having to catch the
ball toss because of the Sun and then it
just seemed to
escalate into some overthinking almost
looked like a a new motion at
times and I definitely still feel like
her racket face is more open than it was
last season at the start of this service
motion
point of the match so far you were play
there from ranu just using a little bit
of
variety
Advantage
Ruku I love that shant didn't make it on
the first round and then still went for
the second chance well the the people
were applauding before the point had
even finished but she's so quick to get
to the ball
great hold there from ricu saved two
break points and levels the things here
in his first set one
all one
game important hold for Raku to get
herself on the
board and the way that she did it as
well few longer rallies nice to see the
variety with the drop shot
too ran so hard for that drop shot she's
lost a
shoe well she received a Time violation
before the match had even started you
can't get one for equipment though so
tying your laces the shot clock will
stop and restart when you're done
out
15
we spoke about the racket speed coming
off that forehand side from Fon Tech but
so far it looks like ranu is hand
handling that really
well but she's having to stay further
back even that last backand has to throw
it up in the air because it's very very
hard to stay at this consistent Pace
with shant so few players can do it
30 15
[Applause]
out
4ing there
Froman and another comfortable hold
there for Shir Shon she leads 2-1 in
this first set leads two games
[Music]
two1 as
always got one in the face yeah just on
the change ever we're seeing the average
Valle hit point from radak CaRu which is
about meter and a half further back
behind the Baseline than chonch and I
don't see that as a negative at all I
think it would be a mistake to try and
equal that position she has to drop back
just to give herself more time so that
she's not rushed and that she has more
options as
well Dano court side can you see that
difference between the court positioning
of shant and ranu yeah absolutely and I
agree with Laura that in Emma's case you
have to give yourself a little bit more
time and space to hit the ball and then
you can always go forward on your shs
because with that intensity sh puts on
the ball you are asking for trouble if
you stay too close to the Baseline
so
good just doesn't want to land the ball
too short does she r
will be all over it and it's not a
negative to stay a little bit behind the
basine EM must got the movement to cover
all the shots possible but as Laura has
been saying to keep up that intensity
throughout the entire match you just
have to give yourself a little bit more
space to hit through your shots
aggressive return there from
Chante getting on top of that second
serve and now Rano under some pressure
Shon tech for me is such a perfect
example to any young player of how to
move forward and back though she never
forgets about those quick small
steps 15 14 and she might start on the
Baseline move up a meter to play
forehand but then it straight back to
that recovery position
gets the winner there shant and breaks
as well so she leads 3-1 in this first
setad three
games rakano didn't do a whole lot wrong
there maybe just not applying enough
pressure off that backhand Drive
volley leaving that slight opening for
Shon radico is going to
change rackets
she's gone for something slightly
tighter here
[Applause]
serving very well thus far Shante
sitting at 70% of first serves in and
when they do go in she's winning 86% of
them and when she gets that first serve
in really sets her up in the
[Applause]
point so some quick games here for
Chante and some opportunities to take a
4-1 lead in this first
set and she consolidates The Brak
Fant she leads 4 One in his first
set games
such a confident start for sh
Tech I saw wi foret get his notebook out
I'm not sure there's much to write down
right
now and I think another advantage of of
having whim in the Box I just feel like
IGA is much more relaxed and calm in
between the points even when she had
those breakpoint opportunities in the
first service game of Emma didn't take
them didn't really Panic cuz he brings
that calmness like he's such a calm guy
to be around and I think he can only do
good to IGA who likes the tension in
between the points I just feel like
overall throughout the season she will
become much more relaxed which is I
think only helpful in her Cas we just
saw a graphic there with eag's Ser
placement almost exclusively to rak's
back hand side something to keep an eye
on as the match goes on
well it's been a quick start for the
number two seed EA
fantech 23 minutes of
play and a breaker
serve leading four games to one so Raku
serving to try and keep her hopes alive
here in this first set
love
[Applause]
it Nick cev the coach of Emma
ranu and a fitness trainer
[Applause]
would you say you'd almost like to see
ranu go for a few more shots like those
I mean at the right time of course yeah
I think the trouble is she's under so
much pressure on her plus one shot you
look at where te is returning from and
how she has that momentum up the
court even though she's missed that 4and
return she cuts off that angle so you
might think the slice out wide is going
to do more damage and then the recovery
back is so quick
so yeah for radak if she's able to get a
forehand on that plus one shot for sure
go for it but she just hasn't had too
many to hit as of
yet and that plus one shot there she
just can't afford to go for this
standard rally ball through the middle
of the court that you can get away with
against so many
people if you're going to try and slow
the pace down it needs to have that Top
Spin rate and the height over the net
40 1
out
really needs to get a few more first
serves in BR CaRu because every time her
second serve she starts the point with a
second serve sh is all over it Raku only
winning 38% of points when a second
serve goes in so it's really tough out
there
oh it's tough off the first serve at the
moment as well for R con F only winning
58% of the first serve
points go to show how well Shian
returns under pressure off both sides
and another break of serve for shant
she's off to a flying start 5-1 in this
first
[Applause]
setad five games
to off to a flyer for sure but I just
think is playing so tactically well
too and in previous games on this du
side it's just been a real standout to
me that 100% of the time she's going to
radu's back end not a single wide serve
on the juice
side and there it is again oh and you
just keep keep going for that wouldn't
you at
5-1 bit more of a
spread on this ad side but still in
general going to the back end
with the second just feels like Raku
can't pressure her as much on that
return and asant always thinking about
that next shot knows that much better
chance for her to get inside the
Baseline on her plus one
1 15
for another exceptional serve there frch
fian and with that
Ace gives her two set points
G five straight games now for the number
two seed go first set runs away with it
six games to
[Applause]
[Music]
one couldn't really have played much
better there sh attch on the
point and always a good start when your
winners are a lot higher than your
unforced eras so fonex just playing a
very clean and clear game
couldn't really put a foot wrong serving
well turning even
better Daniela what would you say some
of the adjustments that Emma needs to
make if she has any hope of getting back
into this match I think she just has to
loosen up a little bit Emma and go for
her shots because EA's consistency in
that first set and the numbers we just
seen I mean they're just too good so uh
first of all my king is you are
help you you look
so another footfall C that's
three so far in this
match 15
[Music]
just feeling the pressure there rakano
off that second serve she knows that
return's going to come back so hard and
fast
[Applause]
[Music]
15 speaking to whim over the last few
weeks as well since he joined the camp
of shant Tech he's been so impressed
with the amount of work she does on on
concentration games on you know Focus
games and how that translates into her
game when she's on the biggest stadiums
in the world
just doesn't give an inch does
she she's
everywhere yeah he's got to be happy
with that
point I mean there might have been a
slight opportunity there for rakano to
at least finish inside the court but
then getting her best ball back and
turning defense into offense
well down there from
ru
14 I think that's exactly what Emma has
to try to do on every single point just
to go for it with her first two shots
because as long as they get into longer
rallies that's where igas got the
sh the first hit in yeah it's got to be
much more
stronger
yes it's been 10 points
play and the shot Ries have been between
five and eight points and it's in favor
of Shian oh look at the average return
speed difference though Shon Tech on
both the first and
second putting incredible pressure on
ranu
Advantage always helps me he get a free
point off that
[Applause]
serve opportunity for ranu to get
herself on the board in this second set
[Applause]
yes she seems to be under pressure in
all aspects of her game you know off the
serve off the return within the
[Applause]
[Music]
rally Raku one win seven losses after
losing the first set against top 10
opponents
advantage
well the back out line Danny that one
looked like it jumped off the
court yeah it looked like it was going
to belong but
it hit the line but I'm liking this game
so much more from Emma because if I'm
her I'm just telling myself okay I don't
mind maybe few extra unforced errors but
I'm going to go for it much
more and maybe force EA that way um to
try to hit the shots even harder and
that's when she might start to do
mistakes
aggression there from
ranu advantage
as D danela and Laura have touched on
it trying to play with a bit more
aggression look to get inside the court
she is comfortable moving forward ranu
just hasn't had the opportunity to do
that so far
she just knows when to step up a not
Tech and pressure you just see the
footwork and the intent behind the
shot you're not going to get a much
tougher Opening Service game of this
second but I think it's that
refusal to not commit to every point
like I think so many people would kind
of throw in an unforced error but you
just see the
intensity with every single shot from
Tech
and that's why she wins so many matches
61 61 six love
62 ADV sh
[Applause]
coach whim with the analytics iPad in
the box and on there you can see things
like serve
placement return
placement speeds of shots
with the break in there second there she
loads one
left so six straight games now for E fan
Laura if you're Emma ranu what do you
need to
do I think she needs to change something
on this
return you saw the average speed and
because the majority of her returns have
been backhand so far and and above the
shoulder shant is trying to kick a lot
of the second serves to that
side so she's either got to commit and
go further up the court try to take it
on the rise or drop all the way back
she's been so impressive fan in this
women singles third
round serving well returning well moving
exceptionally well we know that's one of
their greatest asset so Emma rakano with
some work to do here
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
pretty good front runner you might say I
think so
out 15
that's just the third point that shant
Tech has lost on her serve two of those
have been double faults
one of the better for hands we've seen
from
[Music]
ranu one of the biggest ones we've seen
her go for as well just unleashing on
the crosscourt forehand and that's
something that she can continue to do
more I think often we've seen her want
to play a pretty standard rally ball
through that middle third of the court
but it's not going to be enough
oh that's just too good it's like as
soon as F loses a point she she says to
herself right this next Point's mine
[Music]
Ru always just pulling off that one not
attempting it
4
30 75% second serves one for
[Music]
fante been serving so well today
consolidates the
break Daniela when you're up against an
opponent and the match just seems to be
getting away from you what would you
tell yourself slow things down
again it's a good question because yes
slow things down in between the points
but then I I I keep thinking Emma just
has to accept the fact that she has to
play on a different
intensity and just really focus on first
first two shots on every single rally
and put 100% in it
love yeah it's hard to start the point
when the double faults kick
in goes to show how much pressure ranu
is on after that serve
[Applause]
also maybe to try to throw in some
higher balls couple of sliced beckons
just anything not doing this same thing
for em we saw one drop shot yep she won
the
point 15
[Applause]
it's brutal
[Applause]
 just a little bit of luck going in
the favor there R CaRu
[Music]
so eight straight games now for OS
fante 61 three
love three GES
[Music]
what go
just waited on that
one she did so well with the previous
forehand to get fan off the
court yeah lot to think about out at the
moment for
Raku continues to go to that backhand
side talk about adjustment at this level
you'd think that Emma despite what the
score line
says moving forward would be learning to
know where the patterns of play are
coming from her
opponent guess it's having that
awareness
to well it's the patterns of play but
it's the intensity that stepped up today
we mentioned it at the start of the
match the two opponents that Raku had
played coming into
this they gave a lot of unforced erors
and so to come out here and barely get
any from shant plus the movement plus
the power and
R you know she's played a hand handful
of matches at this level in the last
year mentioned the fact that she missed
ockland but also a big stretch over last
summer where she went into us feeling a
little undercooked had missed a few of
the leadup events there then had to take
an an extended break across the Asian
swing so it's just still struggling to
find the rhythm of these kind of
matches game gets the Lou
F consolidates the break full up in this
second set
[Applause]
thead games
to just has a clear purpose for every
single shot starts with the serve knows
when she's where she's hitting that next
shot also that execution
that's two of the better serves we've
seen from
ranu for
how well does she step into that ball
every back almost hit off that front
foot backand
winners I think that's the 19th winner
from Shan Tech in the
match I think it's the disguise as well
that one could so easily go crosscourt
even short crosscourt because she has
that ability to to just nip one in
just in full control sh that's yeah
there's one forehand in that rally where
you feel radican had to go for more and
then as soon as she didn't Shan Tech
turns the point
[Applause]
round so from 30 love where rakano hit
two big
serves back to 30 all
1
[Music]
14 and then the one opportunity she does
get inside the
court isn't able to ex
because the pressure applied from
Shante yes
Rano pretty much had to hit the ball on
the line to force an error out of Shion
advantage aruk
[Applause]
yes 21 winners for Shon T thus
far 11 off the forehand eight off the
backand
[Applause]
[Music]
advantage and the winners keep piling on
game sh take so another break of serve
forant and in five minutes of Play She
leads this singles third round match
ftic has won 10 straight games and now
she will come out to serve for the match
for a place in the fourth round at the
Australian Open
[Music]
love
[Applause]
15 and you don't want to get too ahead
of yourself this match isn't even over
but in the next round Fant will face the
winner of Evis who was a lucky
loser had two incredible wins to make it
to the third
round and she's up against Jacqueline
Christian
so not that every player is not great at
this stage of the event but it certainly
would
make should te the favor in the fourth
round
and there's the number one ranking in
players well because sabalenka has to
defend points from last year meanwhile
shiant was taken out by Lindon nosov at
early
doors it's all open
f
those you
[Applause]
[Applause]
now
gives the match point for a place in the
fourth round
so a comfortable win for IG this
afternoon she's through to the fourth
round here at the Australian Open 61 6
love oh just a perfect performance from
from the world number two
eag coming out with so much fire power
and so much intensity in Focus as you
would expect from her but she was locked
in
today and ranu will be walking off Court
feeling like
[Music]
