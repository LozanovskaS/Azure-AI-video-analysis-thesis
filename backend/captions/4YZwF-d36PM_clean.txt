D's already mentioned the tension adjustment in Raducanu's racquet. I was talking to Wim Fissette, Raducanu's coach, because she sent off a fair few rackets on a hot day, but only changed the tension by half a kilo, going from 25.5 to 26. The fact that she can feel that kind of difference is quite impressive. The biggest difference for Raducanu today is the level of her opponents in the first two matches. They gave her a lot of unforced errors to work with. In the first round against Alexandra, who plays a bit hit and miss, and Anisimova, there were 44 unforced errors from her. She won't get that luxury today. She holds to love in this opening game.

We touched on Raducanu's newly appointed coach, Wim Fissette, who started with her in October last year. He has quite the experience, having worked with former world number ones Victoria Azarenka, Kim Clijsters, and Naomi Osaka. His approach with Raducanu is to stop her from going for power against big hitters. He wants her to lean into her strengths more and use her movement to her advantage. Raducanu has a habit of trying to match the power of her opponents when under pressure, which has led to losses in the past. Fissette's strategy is for her to focus on her strengths and not get into power battles. It's a good start from Raducanu, yet to drop a point.

Raducanu faces two break points but manages to save them and bring it back to deuce. There's a double fault, a recurring issue in her previous matches. The coaching team is present, with Nick Cavaday in the black cap and Utaka Nakamura, the fitness trainer, in the red cap. Raducanu needs to work on her serve consistency and the openness of her racket face in her motion. It's a crucial point in the match, and Raducanu plays it well, showing some variety in her game. She manages to hold and level the set at 1-1.

A key hold for Raducanu to get on the board, especially with some longer rallies showcasing her variety, including a well-executed drop shot. There's a moment of drama as she loses a shoe while going for a drop shot. She received a time violation before the match even started for tying her laces. Raducanu is handling the pace coming off Shontech's forehand side well, but she has to adjust her positioning to deal with the intensity. Shontech comfortably holds her serve to take a 2-1 lead in the first set.

The court positioning difference between Raducanu and Shontech is noticeable, with Raducanu standing about a meter and a half further back behind the baseline. This adjustment gives her more time to react to Shontech's shots. Shontech breaks Raducanu's serve and takes a 3-1 lead in the first set. Raducanu needs to apply more pressure and avoid leaving openings for Shontech to capitalize on.

Shontech's confident start continues as she consolidates the break to lead 4-1 in the first set. With a quick start and a solid game, Shontech's coach, Wim Fissette, brings a sense of calmness to her game. Shontech's strategic placement of serves to Raducanu's backhand side is proving effective. Raducanu is now serving to stay in the set at 1-4.

Raducanu's coach, Nick Cavaday, and the fitness trainer are looking on as she tries to hold her serve. There's a discussion about Raducanu needing to go for more shots at the right moments to apply pressure. Shontech's aggressive play style and movement are highlighted as she takes a commanding lead in the set. Raducanu faces an uphill battle to stay in the set against the number two seed.

The recovery back is quick for Raducanu. If she can get a forehand on that plus one shot, she should go for it. However, she hasn't had many opportunities yet. She can't afford to go for the standard rally ball through the middle of the court. Against many opponents, slowing the pace down requires top spin and height over the net. Raducanu needs to get more first serves in because every time her second serve goes in, Swiatek is all over it. Raducanu is only winning 38% of points on her second serve, making it tough out there. The first serve is also challenging for Raducanu, only winning 58% of first serve points. Swiatek breaks serve again and takes a commanding 5-1 lead in the first set.

Swiatek's tactical play stands out as she consistently targets Raducanu's backhand on the deuce side. She varies her serves well, keeping Raducanu under pressure. With another break of serve, Swiatek secures a 6-1 lead in the first set. Swiatek's strategic approach is paying off, and her winners outnumber unforced errors significantly.

To make a comeback, Raducanu needs to loosen up and go for her shots, aiming to disrupt Swiatek's rhythm. Raducanu faces pressure on her second serve, knowing Swiatek will attack aggressively. Swiatek's coach praises her focus and concentration, traits that shine on the big stage. Swiatek's ability to turn defense into offense is commendable, putting Raducanu on the back foot.

Swiatek's dominance continues into the second set, winning six games in a row to claim the first set 6-1. Raducanu shows glimpses of aggression, trying to dictate play and take control of the rallies. Despite facing a tough opponent, Raducanu remains determined to play with more intensity and assertiveness.

As the match progresses, Swiatek's serve placement and shot speeds keep Raducanu on the defensive. Raducanu struggles to handle Swiatek's powerful shots and finds herself trailing in the second set. Swiatek's consistency and court coverage prove to be key factors in her commanding lead.

With Swiatek's relentless pressure and solid serving, Raducanu faces an uphill battle to turn the match around. Swiatek's all-around game and strategic approach showcase her maturity on the court. Raducanu must find ways to disrupt Swiatek's rhythm and take more risks to mount a comeback.

Moving forward, it's crucial for Raducanu to learn and understand where the patterns of play are originating from her opponent. Today, the intensity of play has significantly increased. Unlike Raducanu's previous opponents who made numerous unforced errors, Shant barely made any errors, showcasing exceptional movement and power. Raducanu has had limited experience at this level in the past year, missing events like Auckland and struggling to find her rhythm after a break across the Asian swing.

Raducanu consolidates the break and is now up 4-0 in the second set, displaying a clear purpose behind every shot she plays. Her serve sets up the points effectively, and her execution is impressive. Shan Tech, on the other hand, demonstrates great shot selection and execution, hitting winners from both wings. The disguise in her shots adds another layer of complexity to her game, keeping Raducanu constantly under pressure.

In a crucial game where Raducanu had a chance to turn the tide, the pressure from Shant proved too much to handle. Shant's ability to consistently hit winners, especially off her forehand, has been a significant factor in her dominance. With a streak of 10 consecutive games won, Shant now serves for the match, showcasing her superiority in this third-round encounter at the Australian Open.

As Shant secures the victory with a scoreline of 6-1, 6-0, it's evident that her performance was flawless, marked by firepower, intensity, and focus. Looking ahead, Shant's next opponent will be the winner between Evis and Jacqueline Christian, positioning her as a strong contender for the title. With the number one ranking at stake due to Sabalenka defending points from last year, the tournament is wide open for players like Shant to make their mark.

In conclusion, Shant's commanding performance has propelled her into the fourth round, leaving Raducanu to reflect on a challenging match.
