five sets men's singles
final 15
15 off
that's for all
that's quite a nasty slip for Novak
jovic after the serve pushing
off 153 certainly don't want too much of
this the ball arrives back quickly it's
the edge of the left shoe that gives
1530 already
[Applause]
it's a much underrated
serve jovic has it's accurate
be interesting today with Fergus Murphy
in the
chair if the shot clock runs down to
zero whether Fergus Murphy delivers a
warning it's
tight 3 14
I can count on the fingers of one hand
how many back hands down the line from
that position he'll miss over the course
of a match
[Applause]
[Applause]
vage jovic man
[Applause]
one of the features of the semifinal for
Novak jovic against yaniko was the
amount of sliding that he was doing in
fact both of them were
met first
throw let's first
that AG
joov no tournament for no jovic in
preparation for this wimon he just likes
to come here and Win
It Al carth of course winner at Queens
Club from break point down ch ch on
running
and his opponent today was
born caros alaras
t love 15
but you may have to be
love 30 careful Tim if
you get to Novak into those corners of
the Court that's one area where he
excels yeah I mean
it's it was a good forehand from alcaraz
and and that's the response from jovic
on the run so balanced so
powerful jovic with a half
chance let first
just a gust of wind as jovic went to
return that ball it stopped in the air
there was a fine adjustment from
jovic kept the return deep and long and
it's an error as this young Spaniard
pushes hard in the first
game certainly not as windy as
yesterday three break
points let's first
[Applause]
154 he was 20 Goran Ivanovich when he
was in his first Final in 1992
Ferrero looking after Al karth on the
tennis court French Open Champion former
world number one some decent players
these
coaches 304 well the forehead's going to
be key for alarz this afternoon because
he's one of the few players in the world
that can hit with enough power off that
Wing to get it past jovic on the
Baseline
[Music]
and that is away what a return of serve
would set up that forehand
midcourt and having saved a break point
where do you tactically make a decision
to attack jovic in a final light today
that's the hardest part because there
are no weaknesses it's it's very
difficult to come up with that game plan
you know is it to try and hit big up the
middle to give jovic no angles and then
try and go to the corners
is hoping he has a bad day a
tactic it's windy out there just things
blowing off the umpire's chair
15
[Applause]
L Rachel Weiss on the left hand
side Daniel Craig on the right Brad
Pitts in the house as well
up
15 off
oh
s conditions making ball striking hard
for both early
on
15 but that was an extraordinary amount
of time there between the first and
second
serve there is no shot serve clock once
the first serve has been missed but he
is taking longer than
normal if that goes to zero
Mr Murphy will be in there
[Applause]
they hit the ball so
hard if you're just turning on this is
not a computer game they're actually
real the standard of the ball striking
the
speed yeah in these conditions as well
as Todd mentioned it is very swirly out
there Breeze certainly majority of the
time coming from jovic's back
[Applause]
is that in no it's called out Novak is
wiing his finger no no no left
b b was CAU out ah it's definitely will
worth a check it's right in front of the
commentary position here and when he
left it it was like okay fine it's going
out but was it
out
okay
[Music]
4 Carlos alarz has two challenges
remaining
and he's got out of trouble on both his
opening two service games and he broke
in the
midd how does he look like that that guy
Brad Pit 59 years
old senior figure in the American
entertainment industry this is is in
entertainment and this is a great show
the stage Center Court the final of the
Championships
[Music]
Wimbledon that's a wonderful return of
serve 15 while the wind is swirling it
appears that jovic in front of the Roll
box is returning into whatever Breeze
there is
15
all George and Charlotte
just been given no opportunity to settle
this won't help either just a slip there
it's the overextension of the knee is
the danger there isn't
it extension from his opponent making
him work hard here alcaras he needs
to somehow hold this service
[Music]
[Music]
game isn't it incredible how jovic can
neutralize an opponent as soon as they
serve bang the ball's back in point4
five of a
second and that's how it feels to play
noo
30
40 that good challenging the
call right service line all once called
in it's a break
point
saved
ovic has two challenges remaining
hey hey
line ball crosscourt forehand jovic half
fied by alar he was thinking
about challenging that probably
but was blinded by the chalk that came
up off the ball that was relentless from
Serbian no time to settle no cheap
points for alar
jov well it's a horror start for alcar
as jokovic in that first game escaped
the break
point and he's getting a Ming here and
it's embarrassing for you look at that
you can see alar is the world number one
jovic 2 but he'll feel you know just
nothing's going his
way there's no doubt it's uncomfortable
but you know it's best of five sets they
played in Paris alcar lost the first
that first set that day was able to
respond he's got to just take his time
make this set La last as long as
possible what's fascinating go is that
when we talk about what does alcar bring
tactically if you look up the other end
Novak in the four biggest matches of the
year so far has taken the weapon away
from his opponent and he's doing that
already today by going hard into the
forehand of alarz and getting him to
make mistakes
quickly and there's another example of
that so he has gone in to say I'm going
to take your weapon away and by doing
that then where does the opponent go
generally there is the issue of the the
mental game comes into it and belief
starts to
dissipate 1991 champ Michael Ste on the
right big Becka with that forehand
return you may remember
305 it's only the fifth game in you
almost sense from the crowd's reaction
they're having to get behind alar the
underdog really is up against it
well the these next few minutes are just
a time for alaras to just a climatize to
this rarified air and you know try a few
things settle in just take it easy now
this
set 99% is
gone so hopefully relax
G jovic leads five games to L first set
this set is over but I still think this
is an important service game for Al he
needs to just get his side of the
scoreboard going in this first set get a
game on the board and then it will
potentially give him the opportunity to
serve first in the second set
28 minutes played in this first set it's
not a classic so far love
five that'll
[Applause]
do 15 L poor Tunisian player on shur so
popular around the world really had a
hard time against V drusa the Czech
Republic who would end up winning their
women's singles final
yesterday nobody expecting such a a
contest
today felt very sorry for ronj
3 15 well of course we played both
samies with the roof closed on Friday
and you almost feel that Carlos would
have been better off if the roof was
closed out there is a potential chance
at some point of a light shower which
may make that happen I think then his
ball striking will be far more effective
than what it currently
is Novak is I think the best difficult
weather player in conditions of anyone
that's ever played the
game the way he adjusts the way he moves
really really looks like he gets a bad
bounce he's always able to be in a
better position than most of his oppon
I can't believe it
no back jovic's cord speed there I know
the Spaniard won the point but if you
have to play points like alata has just
played to win a game or a
point he's just gone line line jovic
sending messages isn't he's not going to
give up on
anything why that's the way he finished
it come on game point
[Applause]
that's some proper tennis he's on the
board he's got a
game and it's taken over half an hour
for the world number
one to get his side of the scoreboard
ticking the approach was great the
return was extraordinary the approach
was excellent the passing shot was
magnificent
[Applause]
[Music]
spe
[Music]
[Applause]
just a quick message for alcar to his
coaching box but also a
message please do not shout out during
the rally thanks
now that going with the big second
serve 30 love which is interesting
because he often will roll the ball in
but against alarz he knows he can't give
him a chance to actually tee up on the
return so he's taking that weapon away
from him also here in this opening
set 40 love
game and first set
J six games to one new ball GS
15 love it's an uncomfortable start for
alcar obviously losing that first set 61
but I think this is where he's really
got to show the body language to jovic
to the crowd that he's ready to turn the
tables
[Applause]
there's been a vast increase in the
amount of Drop shots being played on
tour people see how effective it can be
Nobody Does it Better on the forehand
side than alcaras and he's lost that
point see how quick jovic was after
that great pick up there from
alab I was thinking to myself before
that the point we've just seen when you
get that forehand you're having a
difficult time trust your strength go
for it again he hit such a good approach
shot and then had to make such a
difficult
pickup 405
[Applause]
and Good Start One Love for first game
second set Todd what are we seeing on
the numbers well we're seeing when caros
goes into attacking tennis the defense
of jovic is extraordinary just have a
look at this the conversion score when
they are attacking alcar at 50% but look
at jovic he's gone hard into the
forehand when he's getting that he's
he's getting control of the point and
he's not relinquishing anything that
number for alcaraz was in the 40s just a
moment ago and it's way down from what
he's been throughout the tournament in
reaching this final
even more impressive considering the
Blustery conditions
it's a big double La 15 first one of the
match after 40 minutes or so first point
of a game is not a good time to
[Applause]
double ah
Jack security Jack he's not watching the
tennis
martial artist that's where he says his
concentration comes froms
that's too long and here's an
opportunity for Al car to get involved
in this you always have to remember that
even the greatest of players come off
their level ever so slightly and after
such a clean set of just two unforced
errors from doovic this is that moment
and so you have to take advantage of it
if you're the young
Spaniard doovic just looking up at his
box a little
bit his turn to be slightly distracted
oh that's well it wasn't lucky that's
one of the shots of the year really he
Clips the tape but he meant it 153 gets
down for both these shots the slice back
and approach balance split step and just
shows beautiful
feel fine
margins could have easily been L
40 time's getting close again three
two and off we go again
that is outrageous
defense and he got so many occasions you
would say well that was luck but jovic
does it so
often 3 I mean such a big forehand gets
the racket out manages to get the ball
back onto the Baseline and then drives
the backand down the line turning
defense into attack just as Todd was
saying
amazing still 30 all and under pressure
disappointed with that 47 94 milph Into
The Hitting Zone on the
forehand at 30
all can't give away those cheap points
not against this man
sorry sorry guys
up
as he dispatches that
overhead Sports psychologists will tell
you that when you're coming off your
level like I just spoke about you need
to take as much time as you can in
between points to be able to sort of
neutralize till you can get your
momentum back
again Novac taking extraordinary long
time in between first and second serves
also
he's averaging 12 to 15 seconds from
here to hit the second serve it's almost
like we need a shot clock on this part
of the
game serve
clock it's very deliberate from him he
knows what he's doing
here and that's wide he's unable to make
it the net cord that he benefited from
early in this game at love 30
and now he uh applauds the crowd in a
sarcastic way why are you applauding
this guy he got lucky I should never
have missed
that he's um mildly offended by the
support his opponent is
getting he likes it when people are
against him sometimes he uses it
see he he's given a dodgy Ball Toss and
then bked again when the time has got to
zero and not got the penalty so he's
he's on thin ice here so where so
where's the consistency from the
umpires you know he's gaining an
advantage by by doing this in in a way
if he'd have thrown the ball up and then
not hit it that's absolutely fine but
the fact that he didn't actually go
through the motion you'd say 25 seconds
was up he's already done the ball toss
up one and caught it yeah in this game
so the letter of the law he's allowed to
do that but if he doesn't throw the ball
up you would say that 25 seconds is up
it should be a time
violation Crow against him the Nets
against
him can Al take advantage
[Applause]
[Music]
Al 48 minutes into this wilan men
singles final alar probably feels he's a
part of it for the first time too love
alarz leads two games to L second set
and it will be interesting to watch how
jovic the four time defending
Champion seven time champion in
all how he react to the crowd's support
of his younger opponent they support his
opponents because he rarely loses
[Music]
love
15 massive occasion for him the king of
Spain is here for goodness
sake last time King Felipe was here he
was Principe Felipe and he was watching
rafan
adal he returns as the king
no
there was a
contortion from jovic here on this
forehand side the great Poise there to
make that shot
[Music]
yeah I've never seen a shot hit with
those physical angles before on the
forehand side jovic unbelievable there
[Music]
brilant brilliant
you're right Andrew he does feel a part
of it now and his ball striking and his
own movement this alarz is actually
lifting he's got the adrenaline going
the nerves are gone and now he's playing
some of the best tennis has played in
the tournament
[Music]
oh that is some good fortune
acknowledged quick nod from Al
karth I think he had that volley it was
a well struck passing shot over the low
part of the net it had power
thanks Corner than
you interested spectator the last man to
beat jovic on Center 10 years ago the
final talking with Neil scopy who won
the doubles with the Netherlands resle
kolhoff
yesterday couldn't find a restaurant to
eat in Wimbledon Neil
and family sub
scy just W Wimbledon can I get a table
[Applause]
he he went after that didn't he 105
milph that
forand one of the hardest he's hit
throughout the tournament only two men
have hit it in fact over 100 miles per
hour off that
Wing C the
other Advantage
vov the job shot hasn't been effective
at all
thus far in this
match just put pressure back on him is
all that it has
done point to get a back on serve
[Music]
a little bit more safety in mind from
alar Chic a huge
Roar over in over in wimon park and
after a 90c rest here come the players
once
again no event complete without a
[Applause]
selfie so just when you thought alth
might get himself ahead enough to make
it one set all jovic is back
oh
no I think it today is really hard to
play 15 that drop shot because it's so
Breezy it it actually as you decelerate
into a ball to give it some softness you
you actually really need to commit in
windy conditions and and the racket has
to get through the hit um fast and when
you take the pace off like that you lose
control of the ball quicker than normal
he won't like being beaten by a drop
shot yeah with that being said Todd you
think you should be playing the
percentage which is you know driving the
ball in the wind not trying to play
those touch and F shots
you
could have made that should have made
that
153 it's a great play to drive the
second serve return and move
forward here it is recognizes what a
good return he's in position didn't need
to be that cute
30
[Applause]
all two future kings
that's first s
he's not getting a lot of first serves
in this set
jovic only
six out of 15
attempts and uh this wasn't a serious
slip that's
more more drama really upset with
himself
in
oh I tell you what what a beautiful
point of tennis in the wind in a final
gruesome that's exactly what he wants
what about some love for
me it's
29 nasty shots lots of footwork heart
rate
up that's the way jovic loves to save
break points him against 15,000
loves
this he'd hate it if we all started
cheering for
him fascinating
matchup one versus two in the world
well he took him set high that point
quickly after the tough rally Advantage
jovic he wanted a short one there
alcarez
[Applause]
yes jovic did well to hit the ball on
the serve there big gust of wind just
took the ball
away difficult day for goodlooking
tennis
that's a great game big got handed to
him 29 shot rally on a break point
down not even close to
missing two games all second
set maybe that's why he's 123 grand
slams and a few other things
besides a winning record against the
other two great protagonists in his
generation fedra and Nadal
there it is there jovic going hard into
the AR's forehand and draws the error
once again I I also
feel I don't think caros has used his
slice back in effectively enough today
it's a very good shot he can hit it firm
short and hard he he absolutely
unraveled meddev in the semi-finals with
that if he could get that to jovic get
jovic to come back with the sze then he
can start to get more forehand on his
own
[Applause]
terms he almost got a couple of those in
that 29 Point rally
yes couple of slices a forand and a
backand and he can get it into his
leftand corner and hit the forehand off
and pull it through the line that his
best shot but Noak so clever at putting
him out wide so that he doesn't get to
the part of the Court he
likes
35 35 well that's just ridiculous isn't
it he's only played 71 slams that's if
he gets to the final of the US Open he
gets to the final of more than half half
of the slams that he plays it's
Madness four major championships each
year 15 the grand slams Australia France
wimon and the US Open in New York at the
end of the
summer this year jovic has won a 10th
Australian Open and a third
French and he
remains the player to
beat
when the chips are down the big
stages it doesn't get bigger than Center
Court against the world number one
[Music]
we saw a couple slce B can there but a
look at this in previous rounds he's had
that mix between Top Spin and slice 5743
today hitting over the ball basically
all the time hasn't used a shot that's
been effective for him in the tournament
Tim yeah and I think that's um you would
have thought an effective shot against
jovic to try and keep the ball low get
it out of his hit Zone
ad Vantage Al an underrated volley it's
a brilliant
volley acknowledged from jokovic
oh juice
[Music]
[Music]
advantage alarz
[Music]
[Applause]
it's a better match in the second set
isn't it Al Kar had a break lost it held
there we see whether no can pick up he's
serving from this bit of trouble with
the Ball Toss with the breeze pushing
that ball forward he's had to chase it a
bit see whether he can make an
adjustment
[Music]
[Music]
brilliant
play for
M working jovic side to side
couldn't break him down so had to resort
to the drop shot set up the backhand
pass just rolled it Cross
Court certainly finding his feet
now looking to dictate these rallies
from the back of the Court
[Music]
up
oh the tennis doesn't get played any
better than the last two
points and this is the level it has to
be against jovic I mean such a pure
strike down the
[Applause]
line looked a little bit like a dear in
the headlights in the first set but
now
alcarez finding his feet
bringing that belief to his player
box there's that bit of an issue with
the Ball Toss from this end
[Applause]
15 Ted after two such good points to set
up L
30 can't afford again to miss that
second serve return
might get away away with it against
other players
but less so against jovic
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
and another that time then much slower
second serve which actually caught alz
off guard a little bit didn't come to
him he it already started the stroke the
ball wasn't there
D
it three games on already 42 minutes in
this captivating set Spaniard has to win
this
lost two stfo situp pass in five tough
sets second round this year Sandy
Murray considered his future went on a
family holiday with the children and
he's playing on
15
BL his dad like the back end volley very
nice technique dad's back end volley
look quite good there in the players
box he does have this complete game
though for someone so young
[Music]
up
it's up and so are many in the crowd of
Standing Ovation for the effort from
both
players this was a very fine adjustment
from jovic to play anything effective
there and this was I mean it was point
over for anybody
else that that is a big effort for 15
love
down every Point matters to this
[Music]
man just a
slight M hit on the return from jovic
just a ball that didn't have much on it
and that's what will do that's what he's
not been able to do throughout the
course of this match because he has been
playing shots from where he does not
want them to to be played
from God this is a high standard tennis
match it really
is yeah
Al polished up with an ace out wide
43 you SE the clock's already running
down here on the serve for the first
point for Novak well let's keep an ey on
it because cuz there's no way he's going
to be serving in 12 seconds time is
there oh no the clock has stopped why
why did that clock
stop cuz Fergus doesn't want to give him
a time
violation that's we we we thought we'd
seen it before now does it matter I I
don't I don't know but it's an
observation and should be made
I think it does matter because when you
are out there and you've got a run of
play momentum on your side Novak's very
good at trying to halt your momentum so
keep an eye if he it gets down in a game
or he's down low 30 he takes a lot
longer and if if the clock is being
slightly stopped or not being officiated
to the degree we would expect then it's
an advantage to Novak
correction
first okay no complaints from anybody
there gold bear jumper since 2001
15
all the 25se second shot clock starts
after the score is called It's supposed
to be 25 seconds between
points and there's at least six seven 8
seconds more often than that something
has to get looked at
305
[Applause]
EX
405
game J
four games all second
set anybody got that
language I would have thought he would
be quite happy about that game because
alros came off his level there didn't he
couple of cheap points from him jovic is
the one up a set pressure back on alarz
the frustration is certainly more down
the Spanish end feeling that jovic
trying to get himself Fired Up by
talking to his Camp to feel connected to
them this is a dangerous game for this
20y old only turned 20 in May
[Music]
5 off jovic forehand just clipping the
tape here just gave alcaras that little
bit of extra time size up the forehand
rips it
crosscourt well that
was replay the point okay and now okay
well replay the point challenging the
right near sideline ball was called in
jovic just checking did you overrule
that yes he did was he right to overrule
it
[Applause]
yes temptation is for umpire to stay out
of it because there's a Hawkeye system
but if it's right underneath the
umpire's chair he can see it
[Music]
[Applause]
35 oh well down jokovic and he's
slid through on his backside there and
the racket's gone flying you can just
leave the racket there I'll get it it's
okay I
think been nasty with the knees this
one 405
[Applause]
again line ball on the Ser 54 new balls
please alarz leads five games to four
second set first set
jokovic thank you your voices please
that's what I mean the ball just comes
through a little differently on the
return patron of the club Princess of
[Music]
Wales hitting a few balls with Roger
fedra as you do before the tournament
first time she' played on grass
no is she any good very
[Applause]
the arm has come out the line
judge and that pass was there and I must
say this was tremendous from jovic
there's not many in the draw and the
forehand pass from alcar to set that up
was exceptional yeah look at this lunge
oh but this is a shot that alar will
make nine out of
10 gosh would have been love 30 but it's
50
all then
it forces 35 that type of
error yes he was at stretch but he could
have got that ball back into court and
gone for some safety instead goes for an
very low percentage
[Music]
that all
[Applause]
called
out Novak
jovic Novak jovic challenging the call
right Baseline ball was pulled out
wasn't the cleanest strike and sometimes
these just dip at the last second
[Applause]
over replay the
point one extra cm long if he' Hit It
One CM
cleaner he could have been down a break
point which would have been a set point
this is a match of tiny margins
I haven't seen alar like
this in a long time especially not all
11 matches he's played on the
grass this is not going as well as he
wanted to
[Applause]
de it's fascinating because alcarez is
feeling as if he has to go big but in
this game he's been given three unforced
errors from doovic he maybe just keep
working the ball around a little bit
more test the champion here as he's
serving to stay in the set don't feel
you have to be the complete aggressor
just at this moment
no absolutely the wrong shot would we
have caught him a genius if it had come
off in the middle of the rally he's
pressured into doing something he
doesn't really want to do you wonder
whether this is a classic example of
playing your opponent not the
ball he has established himself in the
rally
could have just waited to ask the
question but went for the drop shot
[Music]
[Applause]
the speed of
foot yeah we can see you no we can see
you and you're brilliant honestly
it's incredible alcar played the drop
shot jovic was sprinting after it
absolute
Greyhound five games all oh he second
set no chance of winning that
point oh
yeah that his number one fan over there
Jack's got his eye on her
Big Jack on
[Music]
security jovic on patrol for a break
here ball almost hit Jack there didn't
even
notice yeah look at this this
this personality that joker would
and this is also the beauty of the
scoring system you know the pressure was
all on jovic at 45 serving to stay in
the second set plays that strong game
the pressure then just goes straight up
the other end unforced therea love
15 so many champions with us today
they've all been through this both sides
of the net the differing emotions
r
[Music]
is reaching some sort of a crescendo
isn't it absolutely I mean that's how
good that's how hard alar is having to
win work to win these
points still jovic had a play on that
running forehand
3
[Music]
15 neither player thinking about the
world number one ranking they're just
trying to beat the other guy
good change up on the serve he hasn't
used the body serve nearly enough here
this afternoon fastest one of the day
132 into the right hip even jovic
couldn't get out of the way of that one
[Music]
then in
Alor yeah the first set was no contest
this certainly is a contest in the
second set pressure back on jovic
and how 15 how clever is Novak here just
he plays his drop shot but he's watching
the racket face of Carlos he knows he's
got that face closed and he can't hit
the little chip which was the only way
he was going to make it crosscourt so he
knows that the shot sitting on the line
he leaves a little there and then covers
it
Novak jovic challenging the call left
service line ball was called
out second s
5
all Novak jovic has one challenge
remaining
oh
35
there's the mix up from arura with the
slice back ANS just changing the
pace 3
[Music]
[Applause]
40 set
game of
it a tie break it
is first to seven two points clear you
know the deal let me just tell you Noak
jovic one of the great stat break both
players have received for this Serbian
challenge is at the French Open recently
he played six tie breaks and he didn't
make an error it's ridiculous
he's played six tie breaks here he's won
them all he's won 13 tie breaks in a row
and he hasn't lost one since April
[Music]
one he also won
three Roger fedra in the 2019 final here
Baseline ball was called out crazy
record he's won 14 tie breaks in a row
in the slams this year
oh he lost
surprisingly a tiebreak in the second
round in Melbourne to Enzo Kush France
6626 love
it's got a mini break here one
love well he has so many great numbers
statistically to his game doesn't he all
the titles but statistically what he
tends to do in the time break is he goes
Cross Court more than he nor when that
first point it was ALR that took the
risk down the line the lower percentage
he plays percentages better than anyone
in tie
breaks two first
serves then because 3-0 he he defends so
well he then forces the opponent to go
go for more you've got to be aggressive
to win that it's no doubt about that but
he he presses the opponent to push that
button a little earlier than they
actually need
to 10 years ago Mar didn't play any tie
breaks against him just beat him in
straight sets that's the way
the last time jovic lost on this court
how ridiculous
again well carth is in the
breaker 3 2 yovich
[Applause]
W this human up thr cuz that was low
percentage
and look at the right
smile three
[Applause]
all was a long way back wasn't
he to be playing that
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
that was not an easy
volley depping low
missable 43 and trying to execute the
drop volley against one of the fastest
players out
[Applause]
there here it is the
forehand nicely done missed a lot of
those
oh
for all one of the rare occasions you've
seen Novak absolutely commit to the open
court smart shot to go back in behind
him
[Music]
[Music]
oh yes this time and there was
a suggestion of a lingering glance down
the other end he fooled his
man he's set up to hit and then copped
on the four hand side this lovely
drop
54 alarz he backs himself I think we all
had our heart in our mouths when he hit
that shot but on this a occasion was
able to execute it
[Applause]
perfectly five of the last six points in
this tie
break time violation warning oh of all
the times you see and it's fair enough
it's the
rules and we
wondered this time Fergus mvy left the
the time there on the scoreboard just to
emphasize it's at zero
[Applause]
yes no complaints players ready thank
you no time for complaint
a
five all makeable volley yeah there was
nothing wrong with the play was there it
was the right play we've talked about
how competent alar is at the
net been disappointed to miss that five
all
[Music]
up
listen to that
65 that's not exactly a crowd that
doesn't love the
[Applause]
champion that is two tough points
[Music]
set point for a two set lead
jovic
oh
60 as they change hands that previous
Point how calm co under pressure with
the passing shots was jovic and you
almost get a massive surprise when he
misses it a relatively basic ball like
that to bring it back to six all but
there is enormous pressure here can't
take anything for granted on any shot
[Applause]
let for a s
well well
well two missed ground strokes in the
net
six Al
set point the other
way and that's
it seven games to
six cat of Spain never come back from
two sets down and he's managed to do
what so few have done lately winning a
breaker against
jokovic love 15
two
[Applause]
and after a natural high in a match like
a tremendous tiebreaker people go out
they go to the L they put the cattle on
and whatever people are doing the
players have had to come straight out
and concentrate that was a missed
opportunity to take a 30 love lead this
Opening Service game for
jovic 35
that's first off
I don't know much now that could do with
the bounce
there 30 all the court has worn well
this year yeah it has worn well but you
see that's right where the players often
land on their serve it just gets beaten
up more than anywhere else on the
surface like a spinner putting the ball
into that uh well yeah we're going to
stop talking about Cricket soon
standing to LIF and find more accuracy
off the forehand too now is
alz 30 14
w
it's a heavy kicking serve only 91 mph
but had a lot of work on
it this is the point at the French Open
recently in this much stored semi-final
they played these two men that alcar
started to cramp and lost it physically
love the slice backand in that rally to
allow him to get that big forehand him
to set up the controlling of the point
Advantage yeah you really feel that
there's sort of clarity of thought from
alarz using all his skill set look at
that balance just getting across to the
back end using his left hand get round
the outside of the ball another
breakpoint
opportunity let first round was that a
let
well a lead is indicated on the computer
that Fergus Murphy has got and there's
no debating it it's an electronic device
and it just sits in the center
band Novak caught the line with the
serve and liked his first serve
oh
and
alar alar in the lead haven't been able
to say that much
today you rubbing a bit of salt into a
no it's just always four semis kidding
that's why I just ignored Andre have a
look at my record
looking up at his coach and saying good
point wasn't it coach but I still lost
it love
15 such a good good effort from alar to
get the break in the first game of the
third set but he's still got to back it
up it might be the first time for a long
time when we see jovic have to stop
pressing because he's
being pushed around here a bit more than
what he was there in the opening set and
a
half talked about the changes alra might
have to make and now we'll a focus on on
him how he's got to get back into this
alcal really seems like he's now playing
with the freedom he was up against it in
that second set it was a must-win
now he's got
momentum how does jokovic fight back
[Music]
what it seems to me Tim is in this last
15
minutes Novak has had more trouble with
no
pace and generating his own than having
to feed off when AR is actually you know
bullying that ball around the court with
power
4 30 I think it's a bit early to say
that jokovic is rattled but definitely
looks a little bit fragile mentally
right now hasn't had his own way in the
last 15 20 minutes
[Music]
alarz leads two games to love third
set jovic had the chance to go two sets
to love
up and missed a ground stroke in the
net down a break in third
now 15 love
he said the key for him is to smile and
he is now I promise you this little poke
down the line was fun
and that is an elastic
20-year-old really trying to get the
crowd on his side but is that poking the
bear at the other end of the Court
15 C
[Applause]
[Music]
Jak now back did well to get out of that
point it looked like that forehand that
last one that he finished his
semi-final against medev with quite Whi
it as hard but how does he get that
other one most people have had to run on
and slow
down these are must-win points for
jokovic
[Applause]
430 let first
and okay everyone just sort of getting
back in now and Fus Murphy asking him to
sit
down just
[Music]
[Music]
and that's what I
think very well is actually mixed up his
speeds there was an example of that this
was a very deliberate High floating
forehand that got the error from jovic
again
[Applause]
59 Prince and Princess of Wales two of
the three children no Louie
today there's no way he's going to sit
still long enough no chance
15 30
[Applause]
[Music]
coming off his concentration levels here
last two returns of the previous game
was the start of it 154 yeah intensity
just dropped a couple
of poor unforced errors forand volley at
15 all he should have knocked off he
missed it and
now two break back Point opportunities
for jovic
but he adjusted them the high backand he
missed one earlier in the game but the
high forehand this time more
groundstroke errors in the last 15
minutes and uh that reaction was because
of the breeze is holding it up he's
saying I get ready to swing and then the
ball stopping as I'm ready to go at
it Ros alarz challenging the call left
service line ball was called
out second
[Music]
[Applause]
so that will frustrate you because that
was the opposite effect that's the first
one that's really shot through and not
held up with the breeze Carlos alarz has
two challenges
remaining let for s
ah shaping up to hit it to start with
then the drop shot and then just pushing
it through the Cor Advantage alar
jovic going the wrong way with that one
that's not going to feel good for the
[Applause]
boss Chan is gone for jovic
alcaraz leads three games to one third
set
[Applause]
Novak jokovic challenging the
call right slightly delayed call called
out alcarez is having a good long look
down at this Baseline
call
overturn replay the point
[Music]
indecision from
jovic love 15 he was a little unlucky
cuz it was a mishit floating return
haai who can track the ball for us and
suggest that that was actually going out
had he left
it 5 on
[Applause]
up
[Applause]
35 that's first
that's first all
sir
[Applause]
she just bringing this ball back to the
Umpire to Fergus Murphy saying it's a
little bit
soft 3
15 so five balls will be in play instead
of six
4 30 nice to play hand of the Pete SAS
Grass Court book this
[Applause]
one he was chi in charge was that not
crush and Rush more crush and rush but
building
pressure
out that's the kind of pressure it can
bring go a quick unforced error from
jovic
over
Advantage doovic but you do feel like
for the moment that Novak feels like as
if he has to press a little
[Music]
more finding
Perfection close to the line with that
forehand once again off a first hit
he definitely not committing on these
ground strokes and it's a blustery wind
as Todd was saying and it's backing up
on these forehand through the hitting
area just finding his weight lifting or
or coming backwards certainly not going
through the
ball occasionally
too good amazing isn't it
back really gives him the same problems
it's awesome to watch advantage and at
one three
juice to hit a shot like
that the consequences of missing he' be
down at break point for the double break
in this third set
[Applause]
I'm going grayer by the game at the
moment
[Applause]
[Music]
let's first s
[Music]
pace and another unforced erod floa
through the middle when he had to
generate his own
power that one really
thre thank you
deice
he
Advantage jovic well I have a look at
this forehand this is what you're asking
him to do a little bit more Andrew is
that where he got through the ball down
through impact and you see the racket
head straight towards the target the
body weight down the court with it that
was Perfection there
let first s
[Music]
[Applause]
Al's just trying to really take
advantage here some very unexpected
unforced errors from jovic he's got the
break in the third but quite fancy is
the double break
[Music]
when you pass
the what do you mean I mean I cannot get
the towel from the from the B kit so I
have to get to go myself and
get why why do you how do
you I canot speak for you because
there's okay so if I am not able to get
the towel from the buling I have to go
and get the tow but you start the time
how is that here
do it for
[Applause]
everybody this is all about the clock
and it's all about the timing again when
he passes the Baseline it says Fergus
Murphy after a point is ended that's
when he starts the clock Novak making
the point that the tows are a long way
back now and they're not handed to him
by the ball by the ball kids
it's a illustration that exchange of his
state of
mind yeah so often when it's jovic
dealing with
adversity technically or mentally he's
normally so strong but right now he's
distracted
coach Ivanovich looking concerned
alcaraz trying to take
advantage Spaniard holding back on a
forehand opportunity there electing to
roll one in by his standard
yeah he had the ball to
rip and
didn't this is a a tax in game isn't it
a draining game a must win one for the
defending champion
[Applause]
Vantage jovic jovic turned to work hard
to win those points
alarz refusing to give up
and it goes
on D
please
[Music]
[Music]
oh
Advantage alarz the longest game of the
Championships in terms of points played
for NOA
jokovic 18 points one game versus rublev
but remember this is for a double break
this point for Al carath you could say
virtual set points
no it goes on
[Applause]
[Music]
Advantage
doovic some CH tired children in that
[Music]
box they might have to call a medical
timeout ice cream timeout something
decibels are rising with the grunting do
this is they've got a lot invested in
this game both these players and nobody
will know the emotions of each player
better that their Partners wife wait
please boy thanks sir can you throw that
ball back thanks thank you anywhere yeah
before you stick it in your bag thank
you thank you he's been so hard
[Applause]
there he's now blushing yeah I'll send
Jack over there if he's not careful
a
advantage alarz
[Applause]
[Applause]
wasn't the best of volleys it was a
difficult sort of ball
floating he didn't commit totally gave
alar the chance for
that running pass
this is point number 25
worrying a little bit for jovic fans
because when he starts to tie a little
bit he
starts lose balance just flop a bit yeah
and that's starting to happen pushed out
wide the forand a couple of points ago
he looked like he needed a walking stick
at the end of it it's just starting to
get challenging for
him he's got to find a way to hang on to
this serve
ah finding the strength on the break
points
down there is a lot invested this is a
contest within a contest that's 26
points they both are committed it's just
one break of serve at the moment if
jovic can hold on he's inflicted a body
blow on
alar if alar wins the game he's
virtually won the set
that's
tired 2 hours and 47 minutes of
tension if you get to 15 jues you just 7
point look at this young man he's just
getting warmed up he's
20 unbelievable game
[Applause]
help
joov challenging the call left far
sideline well if he's wrong the game is
gone called in you wonder whether
jovic's body was just in front of the
line
judge no
doubt all
over
you Al carth manages
to raise a r SM this is a glorious
game wealth
[Applause]
juice Novak jokovic challenging the call
Right Center service line ball was
called out Carlos has wandered over to
the back end side he s
G the indication it was
in but now he's going to go back nice
bluff nice
bluff not his first rodeo is it
[Applause]
Advantage
vavich Novak doovic has two challenges
remaining
[Applause]
[Music]
up
well there was such a variety of spin to
get to this point where he had the clean
driving flat passing shot but he heavy
High Top Spin ball then that slice one
that dipped hard such variety coming
from the end of alarz it's
just creating some magnificent tennis
advantage alar
[Applause]
and that's it it's two breaks of serve
32 points in that one game
[Applause]
alone 15 l
30
[Applause]
love manelo Santana 1966 Nadal
possibly the greatest match of all time
please no noise during the serers motion
thanks you almost feel that Novak 4 love
maybe has to let this set go and refocus
I mean the physicality of that last game
alone would have taken
a lot out of
him not usually something you would see
him do
though 4
15 no question he's a little rattled but
if alcaraz takes this third set you can
certainly expect the response early in
the fourth from
jovic Carlos alarz challenging the call
right for
sideline ball was called
out second
s game Al
alarz leads five games to one third set
Carlos alarz as one challenge remaining
that was 24 minutes less Long than the
previous
game it's 5-1 but the sets taken 58
minutes it doesn't happen often
[Music]
yeah all mix doubles Partners together
then silver at London 2012
love 30
it does look like he's that this set get
away
and L 14 three quick
points beginning of the third or sorry
fourth set it's going to be
fascinating you still wouldn't want to
give your serve away would you at this
point 14 May Carlos serve it
out then you can at least be leading in
that fourth set if you hold your serve
and you can build pressure that way
there might be a bathroom break after
this
game it will be for
me
G great good set
Al still could be quite a wait
love 15
love
[Applause]
set the
white may have Hur alcar hereit
[Music]
[Applause]
1530 that's first St
[Music]
30 all
all 4
[Music]
30
game straight sets just do him in
straight sets that's what Sandy would do
oh this is superb
running outside an extension of the tra
lines on both
sides 15 well this is point where
Novak's getting the feeling about what
it's like to play against himself
exactly that it's a taste of his own
meds and alcaraz was doing so well to
keep in the point keep the ball
deep oh he jovic challenging the call
right
Baseline ball once you wonder whether
Fergus Murphy saw that because then
alcaras missed the
[Applause]
backand love 30 it's good umpiring it's
good umpiring but it's all going wrong
for jovic right
now let first
1530 norvak jovic has two challenges
remaining
he
great early strike on the back and
return got jovic on the defensive and
down he goes
oh
the back end is still there the forehand
being the shot that hasn't worked as
efficiently or
effectively for Novak in sets
23 still a break point
deice
adventage yovic
and go it
that's a big
hold massive
hold well we found a little on the
forehand but one game all got a graphic
to show you here in a moment to show you
how much his forehand hasn't been
effective today
and here it is so off the quality for
and this is throughout the tournament
speed spin depth and width of his
forehand we can tell how the quality of
shot is and so previous rounds up at 8.2
today at
6.6 that is a big difference for the
champion 15 all
the black one of yours Tim Al alar that
his
finest big first serve ripping
beforehand into the backhand corner of
jovic and then
just knocking off the backand Folly this
is what I love about him there's no
hesitation for a young player about
coming
forward 45
[Applause]
bom
[Applause]
43 CT coverage again from
alarz reflect on the cramping in Paris
after a couple of hours here 3 hours 19
and he's still covering the
court like he's just started
[Applause]
Deuce oh yes
joov is knocking on the door he's he's
doing his best to find a way past
he's having a go at his
camp this is really the a match within a
match isn't it this phase
a little too big and a bit too
low jovic has saved break points already
in his Opening Service game in this
set looking for his breakthrough
advantage alcaras
is that going
out until it hit the the
ne
Deuce here it is down the
line don't
know probably going to find the line but
found the net cord
so don't know
has there ever been a player come along
who with inner rally can just up the
anti a strike that's a neutral ball like
alcare can yeah phenomenal power on that
forehand I don't think I've seen that
and I wonder how much more novovic
wanted in that game
[Music]
[Applause]
15 l
that
love let's first
whoa
[Music]
there was nothing wrong with the
overhead ready 15 one big stride in a
swing of the racket from
alcaraz incredible forand crosscourt
winner
30
Old this is is only his 10th Grand
[Applause]
Slam while the US Open last year the
youngest world number
one Carlos alarz challenging the call
Right Far
sideline ball was called in
asking his team if they thought it was
good it
wasn't second
s where does he go with this second
serve that is creating an angle out of
nothing the return turn was
good deep 40 30 30 all 2-1 down in sets
21 down in
games you think it's going to be easy to
dispose of jovic here nobody's done it
in 10 years and nine days on this court
[Applause]
well there's that slice Brean we talked
about it earlier it wasn't there and
then he has put it into the repertoire
and that's what he can get out of it he
brings jovic forward onto his best shot
that ripping crosscourt forehead
there
Advantage jovic just trying to be a
little bit too cute maybe he should have
he had another chance where he could hit
and rip Drive the back end tried to just
roll it crosscourt
again that was a very positive game from
jovic
two games all for sand extended to juice
though once again still struggling to
hold but some really good backand
throughout that
game no time to be afraid
says carth after his semi-final Victory
no
time for either player
15 love
[Music]
[Applause]
go
he's definitely decided to get more
aggressive jovic here he's flattening
out the ball a little
more going safe A lot of the time with
the hard flat back and
crosscourt so even though he's
aggressive he's playing percentage as
well
he does
that 30 15 yeah where's the leg strength
the foundation from which all of these
shots come
[Music]
30
allz has made a lot harder buies than
that today should have been 405 and puts
himself under a little bit of pressure
at 30 all could have left it it was
going
[Applause]
out that is
out 304
[Applause]
you'd be delighted to be sitting near
that wouldn't you
[Music]
that's a surprise Noak jovic challenging
the call almost feels obliged right
Baseline to challenge ball was called
out a backand Down the Line a fairly
routine shot for him especially on a
break point that he's just lifted up
well
stand
oh that's against the rules for him
Novak jovic has one challenge remaining
[Music]
brilliant
return advantage
he went big with that second serve
and he didn't recover in time drilled
through the center another break point
for
doovic that's long it certainly will be
a challenge but to the naked
eye left Baseline ball was that one was
I mean well no is no might be doing the
bluff as
[Applause]
well overturn replay the point did look
long if it was clear clear he would have
been on his way to the
chair Advantage
[Applause]
jovic break point jovic still
beaten for disguise on Direction and
power that is a very tidy way to save a
break point the big wind
up and a
simple lifted drop shot elegant
Advantage jov it's such a long time
since he's been able to get him running
hard to that
forehead she's the greatest barometer of
where jovic is if she's up on her feet
and she's just into the match you know
it's a big
moment no it's a break SE honestly
and a long
[Music]
final 15 love
[Applause]
yes 15 here the forehand that he starts
to take some angle to Al you see beats
him with Pace he can almost take that a
little shorter and drag Novak wider off
that forehand as well he's got the
ability to do it hasn't used it a
lot 3
[Music]
Fitness physios family
trainers doctors
jovic hamling the backand
crosscourt some were looking for the
drop shot there
405 the champion consolidating or trying
to this
one break trying to push into a fifth
set
4 setting
[Music]
G jovic leads four games to2 he's looked
vulnerable for quite some time jovic but
now starting to turn the tables in this
four set
15 love
oh and that is a wide split in a green
moist area of the Court he says he's
okay glad he's 20 and not 40 as he just
pushes away and that's an uncomfortable
moment the worn patches on the court so
much easier to stand on
that's
fine but you can really
see where Novak is trying to be more
aggressive coming forwards had a lot of
smashes
overheads just I think he feels he has
to try to shorten the points a little
bit Make it try to get rid of those
longer extended rallies
[Music]
[Applause]
oh
405 game
Al new balls
please as we head to
early evening just click over to 6:00
p.m. that wind that was quite an effect
early in the first couple of sets has
dropped just a little I think that is
helping Novak here in the fourth he's
getting a better strike quality on the
ball
again a dictating point from Novak he
the aggressor coming forward
40 l
[Applause]
then jovic leads five games two three
for set
[Applause]
that
L
[Applause]
15 no future with Drop bleys Like That
W called wide well yes called wide caros
alcarez challenging the call left far
sideline ball was called out I think it
was Fergus Murphy who uh called it from
the chair and then the arm came out from
the line judge
actually stand very late very
correct love 30
well jovic it goes without
saying would like to take this set now
and open the fifth set on his own
dealy 1540 Carlos alarz has two
challenges remaining
[Applause]
game and
foret the final match in the men's
singles championship of wom and this
year will go two setu
deciding fifth set new territory for
both players
[Music]
15 l
The Bu that
[Applause]
love let first
off e
it's a dismissive
swipe both
4 hours played and both players moving
well so all back in the game caros at 30
o no hesitation on that one as soon as
he knew he had jovic at full stretch
jovic taking the opportunity to move
forward not the worst approach he's ever
hit look at that passing shot from
after let first s
[Applause]
only 117 milph but beautifully
placed advantage jovic
[Applause]
[Music]
spe
a are you kidding
such a good point and such a good
reaction from Alara how is this
forehand D just curls it around the
corner holds it and whips around the
outside over the high part of the Nee it
was so low such it's a difficult shot
spin from low in the court that takes
great racket head speed to create
this is class serving though and a early
pressure in
this with the fifth set
[Music]
and Y
saving a break point and coming through
in the first game of the fifth set just
as in the first game of the fourth
Todd well we talked about the forehand
at the beginning of the fourth not being
as effective throughout this match as it
has been the tournament in sets one to
three jovic's average Rally Point was
here on those red dots to find a way to
get back in without his forehand today
have a look at what he did in set four
he got inside the Baseline to take time
away from alarz and that was a key to
getting back into this
match Carlo salz challenging the
call left Baseline ball was called out
seen so many swings in momentum in this
match and it was jovic dominating that
first
set alar is doing well to get back in
the second on top in the third and
chances early in the fourth but right
now you
feel jovic is looking to take
advantage strong Opening Service game
love 15
[Music]
here 15 all Carlos alarz has two
challenges remaining
[Applause]
a
15
setting he's five victories and one loss
in five sets at Grand Slam finals
3 it's a long run at any stage of the
match let alone second game of the fifth
after 4 hours and 8 minutes but he he
wouldn't make that effort unless he felt
like it was worth it and as he's on
complete automatic pilot absolutely and
sends a message that jovic is going to
continue to chase it
down such a deep return that I think
alarz was hoping for an out call
wondering whether he should challenge
30
14 does the match turn here
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh he had to play
it was it going in
it was going to land in he had to play
the ball it was tough listen to this
battle joined in the fifth set at this
men's singles
final break points saved by the young
man
[Applause]
superb the presence of
Mind advantage
alarz that's a thing of beauty isn't it
jokovic Absol absolutely left flat
footed and he's one of the
quickest to
say a man who reads the game so
beautifully didn't see that coming
[Music]
[Applause]
the levels are just
incredible defensive skills of both
men how quickly they can turn defense
into offense like that point there from
alar the athletic ability of a couple of
points to go and then the explosive
power on the forehand side
aren't they going to be getting
tired too much on the line now for that
love side to side it'll be the kitchen
sink next that was huge there L had to
act
[Applause]
quickly you only get one point for each
of these points they're giving at
[Music]
all 15
[Applause]
all 110 lost one five set matches at
Wimbledon last loss
2006 Noak jovic challenging the call
right service
line and if this were to be in the call
came a long time after alar has made
contact with the
return second s fortunately it's out
what I'm find interesting here is that
he some width on the AR so he can get
forward to get these volleys Novak wins
through depth in this match I feel in
the fifth and the Spaniard wins through
opening the court up and pushing his
opponent into the corners
so there's the depth of the jovic
forehead
[Applause]
[Applause]
34 who's going to take their chance
first in this fifth another break point
for alar
[Music]
oh the rocket has been melted against
the Net post that's what the f are all
[Music]
about shaking his hand out though after
that return you wonder whether they uh
racket end of The Net post reverberated
into the wrist it's a it's a pretty big
piece of tree
that lovely into his brain right now
jovic needs to
regroup well right about the
wrist 3 l
oh 40
[Applause]
[Music]
Love Again out
that's a very straightforward game and
well played 3-1 a consolidation of the
break of
serve alarz leads three games to one
final set and a broken record as well we
remember disqualified at the US Open in
2020 after unintentionally hitting a
line
judge was a dangerous moment please a
lot of
[Music]
reasons still shaking that wrist around
15
L alcar was able to run away with that
third set like to do the same in the
fifth but pretty sure jovic is going to
have other
ideas expect it little all here like
we're having him getting turns back into
play at some point here because the
opening few games was so
intense that's who gets back onto the
game
quickly 4 love
405
again good
it that's a first class response
great depth on that approach shot from
jovic just checking on the line love 15
[Applause]
F wow
was that a second serve it
was 121 milph at love 15 we see jovic go
for the big second serve but less so
alar and he backed it up with a whipped
forehand as well with no margin
brilliant play
oh 153
[Applause]
what a gift what a
gift don't see that often with jovic in
any
match fifth set of a grand slam
final talked about jovic's five set
record how about kind of
[Music]
eight and
one oh he's lifted up again and the
breeze at his back it's the first time
for a while where the the breeze held
the ball up 4
setting it's
been Ling long for a while and now it's
back in
here caused that one to be
mistimed alcaraz leads four games 22
final
[Applause]
[Music]
set 15
love he spoken about jovic taking his
time in between
points seems like he's rushing a little
here
[Applause]
5
all not the cleanest of strikes from
alar but the ball just
dipping inside the
Baseline let's first
he's got uncles up there he's got
Brothers he's got his agent Mom and Dad
physio
35 really getting inside the Baseline to
take the time away from alarz that's the
only way it seems that he can press
that's the problem though if you come in
on a Top Spin approach
shot he has absolutely mashed this ball
look at that ball sit up though gave
alar time to be able to really rip this
one but still he's so deep he's in
midair and he's been out there for four
and a half
hours it's too good
Novak jovic challenging the
call Right Far sideline ball was called
out challenging between first and second
serves can be a little offputting for
the
Rhythm now does jovic go for the big
second
serve somebody whistling totally
ridiculous
that is
tough again and again we've seen this
man produce his best under the most
trying of circumstances people whis
jovic has one challenge remaining the
wind's been swirling he's down 24 in the
fifth to a kid who won't go
away I good the feeling he loves
it what a hold it's magnificent what you
expect from the champion new balls
[Music]
please that's
away a sliding pouette from the Ser love
15 look at this right leg goes down
decides to go that way
first Ser was a little tight halfway up
the net but a quality kicker on the
second with the newer balls probably
just getting a little bit bigger on
jovic 320 points played
[Music]
[Music]
30 15 another one just perhaps flying on
jovic you balls a little a bit quicker
through the air skiding through off the
alcar
backand
oh excuse
me a change of direction that nobody
knew was coming and I suspect alar the
only one and
just flx is
everybody
out what a hole from love 15 down
second game in a row he went down in the
count and produced a bit of
magic Al absolutely Fearless tennis five
games through three final
[Applause]
set thank you thanks players are ready
15
[Music]
L Carlos salar challenging the call

Baseline ball was called
out stand
30 4 love Carlos alarz has one challenge
remaining
[Applause]
45
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah it
[Applause]
love
15 exactly what no that was hoping for
oh how cheeky is
that he invited him into the net and
then just lifts the lob over a lazy for
hand Top Spin as cool as you like he's
just missed a drop
shot that's well handled by jovic as
well but look at the control under the
most severe
pressure oh my
goodness
brilliant from both
jovic went down got up again slight Miss
H it the pass was excellent the reach
was better
[Applause]
so home
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
47 finding the first servant he would
certainly like another one here
[Applause]

Center Court
