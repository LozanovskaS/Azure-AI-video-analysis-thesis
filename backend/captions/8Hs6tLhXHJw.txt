bye
[Applause]
love 15
gys has been looking to step in on
returns and and attack her opponents
Shan has to be aware of
that trying to put a little bit more
behind that second serve clipping the
tape
just so quick isn't she so athletic to
get up to that short
call fiant
well possibly a little bit of a nervous
start here for the world number two over
playing that forehand
our first serve is going to be crucial
for fian just to allow her to play from
a stronger position
especially in these early stages it's
one area she's been doing a pretty good
job of throughout the tournament
rning BR for Madison
[Applause]
keys keys gets just what she was hoping
for when she chose to receive
opportunities to break and she takes
advantage of it Shante is now broken for
the first time since
the fourth game of the second set in her
first round match she's won 31 service
games in a row Shon Tech and that
stopped the run there
all right good start for Madison key and
it's good to have Daniela Hova Courtside
Daniela a warm welcome to you thank you
so much it's great to be with you Josh
and Chanda and uh just want to say a
couple of those misses in the first game
also had something to do with the light
Breeze that it's coming with from the
side where medicine is going to serve so
it's something both girls have to watch
out for just give it a little bit extra
shape to make sure they don't miss it
long long as EA did with couple of those
forehand Chand I get the feeling
tonight Madison Keys will have to serve
well and I'm thinking around the up 65%
plus of first serves in because her
serve plus one is so devastating
yeah I think that's been a key for Keys
getting to this semi-final she's
maintained a pretty high percentage of
fur serves in and when she gets the
serve in she's effective behind it and
so it's the the onew
punch when that number has dipped it's
been a little more difficult for keys
wow rante You' got to be ready for those
extra balls to come back Keys was up for
the challenge 13 15 it started that wide
serve well place to get shiant stretched
out that has been difficult for
opponents to do uh thus far but he's
with a terrific start
[Applause]
we know how quick shant can play in
their moments where Keys may have to
just slow things down a little bit try
to control the pacing a bit more often
14
1 now she had a look at for hand she has
been pouncing on yes and that one just
got away from her the legs didn't quite
stay grounded and behind the ball
understandable to be a little over
anxious looking at a a two love lead
here
is there anybody better in the game who
can turn defense into attack than EIG
Shante Advantage it's hard to to think
of anybody obviously gof who can defend
and at times go to offense but shant
does it so quickly and so seamlessly
nice rebound here from the world number
two hits straight back one all first
set there are players that are very
comfortable defending but then it's
difficult to go from defense to offense
inside the coord and beon she is
probably the best at
that this is where mie will have to be
so careful when she has those easy balls
that she make sure finishes eiga
off and is very accurate with those
otherwise the balls will be coming back
love shant still not quite settled
in in terms of her her
serving second double fault
a bit of good fortune for keys to put
shiant under more pressure here at 30
love
30 three times that Shian has gotten
that second serve in she's lost all of
those points so far
and guys what I'm noticing is that IGA
so much wants to be ready for that first
shot after her surf because she knows
how fast the returns will come of
medison Racket that she doesn't finish
the surf properly she's a little bit of
Rhythm she almost worried about that
shot coming back isn't she totally
that's another break for Madison Keys
twoes good start for the
American 2-1 first
set and we have a full house here for
women's semi-finals
night Madison Keys up a break 2-1 first
set 59
93% Madison Keys wins the set after an
early break so that's a very healthy
number and chanted the highlights just
how she's a great front runner and
understands the Staples of her game and
and how to keep it flowing through the
end of a set
and certainly those weapons and closing
out a set that helps as
well
let's well you need a little bit of luck
at this stage of the
tournament 1 that's a second net cord
for keys that one no chance for shiant
to
defend sometimes to the aggressor goes
the
luck we have seen this occasionally
haven't we Chanda throughout this
tournament where she does throw in the
odd double fault and it looks like
a little bit of loss of Rhythm yeah
Madison Keys's team her coach and
husband beor friend tangelo and then
right her fitness trainer on the left
rard Langford works for the USA
just missed
it that has been a valuable shot for
keys the backand down the
line and instead it's a break point for
shiant
game all right two
G two games
all not entirely happy with that service
game I'm
sure yeah this is the the challenge of
settling in as quickly as possible in a
match of this magnitude and both players
still just not quite finding their range
and you feel like whoever can hold first
that is the player who will be able to
settle down a little more quickly but
you see they're both trying to play
aggressive on the front foot and that
will generate a certain number of
errrors as
well 15 left
Tech has finally won a point off of her
second serve maybe that gives her a
little boost of confidence still right
now just trying to overplay on that
shot 30 left
he
[Applause]
4 these are exactly the type of Misses
in the last two minutes that MADD cannot
afford to do in this kind of match up
against EA is so not used to being in a
situation where she's too old so that's
already stressful for her so she has to
cut down the number of unforced error
account
M ke had a point for two love lead and
didn't get it it's been a bit of a swing
back and forth for her got to put those
missed opportunities out of your
mind not always as simple to do
it's a first service hold for the world
number two starting to look a little
more confident 3-2
Fant so maybe just a little bit of rain
actually I can feel a few drops around
so hopefully this gets closed on time
well it just takes six minutes they say
and obviously they've got a good start
so it'll be less than that it wasn't
wide open they took 300 tons out of this
roof when it was originally built so
used to take 15 minutes and now it's
just a matter of minutes before it
closes oh but I think both players
decided that they keep playing even when
the rose
ising at the same time yeah and the the
referee tournament referees just
mentioned that this will it'll be closed
very quickly so the show goes
on CH I to say shant's doing a very good
job of going back in behind Madison Keys
really trying to keep her off balance
yeah's coach wiim facette added him to
her team and and one of the things that
he talked about doing was having her
lean into the spinnin of her shots on
these
courts and what he what he spoke about
was you know before she tried to flatten
her shots out more on these courts make
that adjustment compared to how she
plays on the red clay but this year he's
been having her lean into the spin and
keep with that same kind of shot
production
forehand is just a little loose at the
moment this has been a big weapon over
the last couple of
weeks a very close-knit team for Madison
Keys in the middle her physio Kayla
erson as
well little concern though right now
154
and that's the range that Keys has been
looking for on the
forehand it makes life a lot easier for
Madison Keys when she makes that first
serve only winning one out of five when
she misses the first
serve G just over playing at the
moment that is such a difficult forand
to hit as good as Keys forehand is she
was still just a little off balance and
the change direction behind that much
Pace from shiant was little too much to
ask for especially given the rotation or
the spin that chiante puts on the ball
you're almost on your back foot at all
times so if you want to change direction
of a shot you really have to be set with
the feet and have great discipline a
change
direction out
15 shant still trying to push for more
depth on that second serve trying to
keep keys at Bay
again that back in behind Madison ke
shot a clear tactic we're seeing from
eag
[Music]
15 this is staple of Shan how quickly
she gets the feet in position behind the
shots difficult to get her off once she
gets started
that's the kind of return fian has been
trying to avoid from keys where she can
take that little bit of Court steal some
time from shiant right from the
start that return was on ig's side
before she even finished the surf
she missed that forehand keys but that's
a good play Still she kind of ran
through it didn't quite get set but the
intent to hit it and then move in where
it doesn't allow shiant to reset the
point she did that well in her last
couple of matches
14
13 set there the front left
I like this this forehand better the
cross cour forehand from Keys is working
better tonight yes seems to be trusting
the
shot and it gives her just a little more
margin over the low part of the net and
she can swing over the longer part of
the Court as well
[Applause]
one of the advantages that shiant has
though she hasn't
always maybe like these courts as much
she gets a little more time she can make
great use of it
she seems like she is finding the joy in
these Australian open
courts well it's been a nice recovery in
first set from the world number two good
lead 52 first
[Applause]
set Daniel just checking in is the
actual roof completely closed now yeah
it is absolutely
Josh it feels so nice conditions
couldn't be any better just the right
temperature no wind
perfect and those are the types of
Misses that Keys can't afford in this
match it's been hard enough for her to
get those
opportunities be on the fr front
foot 15 30
[Music]
good reset here from love
30 back even with that
Ace the first Ace of the
[Applause]
match well it's it's been quick 32
minutes it's
a set point now for eish
[Applause]
Fant yes
[Music]
Advantage peace
nice rebound from Kei saving a set
point just giving herself one more
opportunity to get back into this match
and she knows keys that even if she does
lose the set here she wants to be
serving first and the second so multiple
benefits buckling down in that last game
beor Fran Tangela just laying down the
LW hasn't been overly animated this
tournament with Madison this time he
was a lot more animated than what we
have
seen that's that's the way I think P
wood from Madison trust her best shot in
Cross Court then when she gets more
confidence she can go back down the line
but this is the shot that we've seen
Iger struggle a little bit over the
years hard and fast into her forehand
side and especially with keys coming in
now she's got to hit it a little lower
try to get it dipping
[Applause]
just sitting Courtside it feels like you
cannot hit and time the ball any better
than the last two shots of medison
[Applause]
St
this is what Madison Keys can do she can
get on a run that last service game
first time she held serve all match
saved a a set point and now with three
break points to get back on serve
[Music]
out 15
14 a smart second serve from Shante got
a lot of safety on that kick serve but a
terrific
angle as well as the kick that got up a
bit higher
133 14
is getting interesting now Madison Keys
does break back and we're on trying to
take 54 first
set love 15
being a lot more disciplined on the
forehand Madison
K well her shots are big enough and and
you see
how difficult it's been for Shante to
catch up to it to get behind it fully
when Keys hits solidly doesn't even have
to be that close to the
[Applause]
lines 1 M fan is almost ready headlining
it here
and she was close but still down in this
game
now 14 15
I mean all you could do is laugh at that
one it's either that or
cry that gives every Club player Hope
[Applause]
makes no mistake of
it
five tremendous Poise and discipline
from Keys shant almost reset this point
with that forehand
Keys very calmly taking her
opportunities and again away from the
lines and enough height and margin over
the
[Music]
net up
two of the best first serves that shant
has hit back to back
49
[Applause]
needed it J Tech moves
ahead 65 first set
[Applause]
15 just the middle of the Box is always
going to be problematic
she has just started to hit the for with
so much more shape ever since she was 5
to down medicine feels so safe the last
couple of minutes
it's almost as if Keys has realized she
doesn't have to rush through her shots
and even if she has to hit two or three
maybe even four big shots she still can
keep control of a point with how big she
can hit it
doesn't have to make it more
risky and I think that's the key for
medicon tonight to accept the fact that
she does not have to win every single
rally within two three shots but she has
the
physicality to stay in the Ries for say
seven eight n shots if she needs
to just taking away time from Madison
Keys and earns another set
point 1 14
[Applause]
first set it's a good set of tennis from
the world number two G to get halfway
there takes the first set seven games to
five
15 left
how
even at night with maybe slightly slower
conditions Key's ball still just moves
through the court and when it hits kind
of keeps moving that's been the
challenge for Shian why she's working so
hard to try to get behind these heavy
shots
and Chandra I don't think the game plan
necessarily changes dramatically for
Madison I don't think it does I think
she had the right game plan plan and
certainly from 25 down she started
implementing this game plan hitting big
looking for opportunities to take the
ball out of the air not let chanch reset
the point and it also cuts down on the
risk she's not having to hit extra big
shots from the
ground 154
see a little bit of Doubt
here from eish
Fant so it's the perfect start for
Madison Keys break in the second set
love
15 both these players are terrific
return Turners in slightly different
ways and you see shant also trying to
step inside the court take those balls
on the
rise not give keys as many UNR returned
serves pretty good percentage of
breaking right back as
well that's
stunning 153
great
footwork 30 Old when keys gets into to
position that way she has options she
can go inside out she can go inside in
it kind of freezes Shan where she can't
read those shots as
[Applause]
well because she has such a shoulder
turn on that forehead it is impossible
for IGA to read where she's going to hit
and at this speed you have to start
guessing a little bit before my hits the
shots it's been a good start hasn't it
for
was able to get over the
disappointment of losing that first
set and it's been a strong rebound two
love this was the same position Keys was
in in the first set where she had broken
and had game point for two love couldn't
get it and that changed the complexion
of the first
set maybe now she can continue to
implement this this strategy that has
worked that is the first time
Madison Keys has held serve after
breaking serve so that's got to feel
pretty
good
159 and even though she lost the first
set Keys it still feels like this match
is more even and it's because of how
Keys has been able to control play in
between certainly the first set those
few games and now beginning of this
second and this starts to be a big
gamean doesn't want to give up a three
love lead here
[Music]
1 15 so much for Shian starts behind the
first serve and not just any first serve
but she's got to keep placing it well
and mixing it
up I think not just mixing up placement
but also mixing up pace
mixing up spins sometimes the quicker
she serves it the quicker the ball is
back on her like that last
one oh stunning
she tried it she tried a little slower
sirve with a little more angle and keys
on the full stretch using every inch of
her racket frame
good stuff again from Madison Keys and
it's another
break it's game on three love Keys
second set an incredible Australian
summer winning Adelaide five matches
here right in it 5 up
13 and guys also the conditions are much
warmer now than compared to the
beginning of the match so medicon big
shots are even bigger starting to be
really hot and
humid
49 just as they are we Madison King
train
down in
Florida three straight
[Music]
[Applause]
Aces gain so real run on at the moment
from Madison Keys and there's some
question marks here for
eish full
love all shch could do was watch those
serves whiz
Pastor finally got something more
hitable the last point of the game
but had an uphill battle and she does
here trying to hold serve
Shante tangelo pan of Min just keep it
going he was very calm
and the self-belief
before this match when we spoke to him
very impressed with Madison
now she's been hitting it big keas
and after the first set 15 she started
hitting it just a bit
bigger her average Top Spin speeds are
up on both sides
[Applause]
love
30 well here's a look at the numbers on
the forehand side Keys 6 km per hour
faster between first and second set and
on the backand even more of a difference
that's big increase isn't it and that's
what chanch is struggling more with
right
now
[Music]
153 this is sometimes
the the look we get from eager when
things are not going her way gets a
little uptight and the body language
does change
[Applause]
I take his out of
sorts yeah she's definitely in a panic
mode so huge mental test for IGA how she
can get out of this cuz she's panicking
mentally and on her shots as well
it's all oneway traffic at the
moment
fantastic event for all to attend and
it's Madison Keys who's in control in
this second set five love
we now
5 all
so much to like about this
forehand this is the shot that's really
worked a treat All Summer
Long a little shaky early on in the
match but boy full of confidence at the
moment
[Applause]
those shots for Shan have been few and
far between where she's a been able to
set up on balance on the front
foot p
out 13 14
game TR it's one game back but it's a
long long way back
51 Keys
leads fan at least able to hit pause on
all the momentum Keys had still there
for the American but just little bit of
a shift to shant's side especially if
she can hold serf here
that's
wild 15 desperately love to hold on
here I wouldn't think she'd be too happy
if Keys starts serving first in the
third
just lifting up a fraction the
head the struggles for shant in this
match have been very different than her
previous matches she was up around 80%
of points W behind the first Sur fiant
which is why she held for so many games
here not even winning 50% when she gets
the first serve in
drops dramatically behind the
second got to give Madison Keys a lot of
confidence why not this way this match
is gone from 25 for her has been
confidence
building and she is point away from
getting this to a
decider 154
[Music]
[Applause]
3040
it's well long and we're Going the
Distance Keys has wrap this women's
semi-finals up and we're one set all
15
[Applause]
left whatever Shante does she has to
work on spreading the short again and
she's lost a bit of confidence on some
of her shots from the ground so that
will be a challenge but she can't just
look to go toe to- toe from a neutral
position Pace
wise keny feel like she's lost a bit
physicality in terms of where she
started the footwork and the whole
intensity some of it I think she almost
overthinking she's focused more on that
big hit she's trying to generate the
pace first and foremost and it has made
her footwork
suffer 14
15 but it's also been difficult for
shvan to read some of the shots from
Keys now that Keys has started making BS
way she did
towards the latter part of the first set
it's a lot of
changes so much to love about the start
from Madison Keys
that's the sort of Point that's the type
of points f Tech runs to play well I
think that's what the goal needs to be
regardless what in this and she's missed
a few shots but don't give keys the same
ball to the same side of the Court twice
if at all possible
1
[Applause]
[Music]
it's imperative that shant keep some
pressure some tension in this match in
terms of the score
line well on her way to start in this
service game
14
15 I think it's misses like this one
that have to give Madison that extra
boost of confidence I mean this wasn't
close to making it over the net she's
missed some shots from the ground wildly
Shante
has and she settled back down
that's going to feel pretty good for EIG
shant after not holding serve at all in
the second
set that is fantastic Vision just out
low look how she was spreading the court
there shant moving keys
able to get the balls more into the
corner but it was the variety of
placement that helped get her up there
at the net
it's up Tois to
respond Danny are you seeing a
difference in chant just
physically I think she's a little bit
more urgent in between the shots but the
key
here for me is to find a way how to open
up the court so that even if Madison
hates these huge shots she has the whole
Court then to play
with is so much easier said than done at
this
speed this serves worked so well the
slider wide
it's something she's done so beautifully
in her career and she hasn't overused it
tonight but that one another
strategically placed serve get out in
front
40 like here how Madison Keys is not
panicking didn't overplay the pass it's
got some beautiful dip and shape on it
[Applause]
at the spein on that
ball now she did well ke to defend and
keep herself in that point for the extra
ball and that's that's exactly the
backand that Shan has been so affected
with throughout the tournament that hard
short crosscourt she needs to find a way
to use that more
often again holding strong mentally here
Madison Keys a lot of
self two one final set
59 each service game is its own battle
and for IG fanch right now she cannot
afford to lose those battles on her
serve just taking a little extra
time being a little clear on where she's
placing the ball and what the result
that she wants
definitely trying to hit that back hand
down the double hand of down the
Lun she hasn't quite gotten it
consistently though that was the shot
she missed on that first set point that
one just seemed a little tentative like
she didn't quite commit fully to it
slowed her racket head speed up behind
it
and chander feels to me that just
starting to slow the first down the
first serve down a fraction because
she's afraid of missing that first serve
and having to hit a second
serve just then that makes your game all
that little bit more cautious as well as
well
do we think maybe this is the time on
that second serve that Med should go
inside the Baseline just step in Take It
On The Rise and just send the message
across to IGA this is my time I'm
hitting the ball as well as I can and
just maybe be even slightly
aggressive yeah she's she's got those
opportunities Keys especially held serve
serving first in the
rotation that's got to feel like a GI
hasn't up that was a
big round Tech these are the shots that
she was executing in the first
set so first break point of the third
set goes the way of Madison Keys
he needed to go back cross cour one more
time Keys that's where she's had success
nashon got
fortunate another point in this game
that she was on her heels and keys just
missed
it a little more Pace into the body of
keys 178 good Cole Chand
[Music]
G
two the first test igis
Fant two all
[Music]
had to work hard for that point and at
the end kind of shoveled the backand
down line didn't want to miss it so
scoop almost all she had to do was make
it huge game for the
[Applause]
pole 15 left
f
made something out of what was almost
nothing could have been a
disaster yeah sometimes she gets the
Fate there too early and gets planted
and then I think she was looking to
maybe run in and hit a volley and then
decided at the last minute it was
dropping a little too much so she put
the brakes on good adjustment good
enough
left for
sir 1 15
[Music]
again I just think Shante she has to
more times than not a establish that
she's going to go into the Open Court
establish that she's going to move the
ball and then she can maybe make
adjustments and go behind keys but that
was another excellent rally and it's not
easy to do at this stage but that is why
shant has been at the top for so long
may be a little counterintuitive because
it's not easy to move the ball in these
tight situ ation but for a big hitter
that wants to be on balance it's more
difficult to do it if she's having to go
side to
sideon earning a break
point no
P from
K and what a first serve that she rout
Under
Pressure that's a perfect point from
Madison those were difficult shots me
she made the first backand look easy and
it
wasn't very confident
hitting and an in
je to use this
serve ever so well the slider wide on
the juice Court
what a battle we
have Madison ke's holding on and leads
32 fin three against to
two 15
[Applause]
I think EA should use the body Ser here
as much as possible
even though Madison lost that rally I
like her positioning on that second
serve she was standing almost on the
Baseline being much more
aggressive let
f
Shar Keys leaning May expecting the
backand te able to swing it way out wide
[Music]
[Applause]
145
she ran into it yeah got too close to it
completely off
balance on that
backand you can see almost jumping
through the shot she lost her base her
footwork
new balls
please so games all that'll just change
things a little bit it'll be
quicker it's got to feel like shiant she
is living on the edge knows that she
cannot afford to drop her serve here not
that she can't create break
opportunities but it's been that
difficult against the key serve
especially when she has had a lead been
out in
front under pressure and shant again
coming up with the
goods 15 it has been so different
tonight for EGA up to this stage of the
tournament she's done such a good job to
follow through with her body after her
shots especially up the line she just
does not have time to do that
tonight 30
[Applause]
1 15
[Music]
all
patience here in this Rally from eant
back to 30 all 30 all
[Applause]
what a
shot yeah if this pump shows that was
not an easy
shot almost falling off the shot of
fraction and just got into position just
in the nick of time and that is as good
as you can hit it
let for sir
brilliant Madison ke against the
three wow in front 43 final set
it's a couple of times Chand she just
almost overrun that and got too close on
the backand side it's the right idea
again she's trying to move the ball and
just keep keys off balance enough but
she wasn't really ready to hit that shot
and wasn't comfortable with
it there's a chance at love 30
for Madison
Keys such an advantage of serving first
on the scoreboard Fields like you're in
front at
4-3 well still on serve
153
[Music]
[Applause]
Yeah
Boy keys to that lob up Qui
High a lot of tension in this moment
couldn't hit a better serve down break
point 14
[Applause]
[Music]
yes
[Applause]
and up fromon that ball that serve a
little slower had a little more Spin and
it was to the Keys
forehand wasn't
expecting that much of a
Slowdown maybe just over it a little bit
there Madison Keys couple of break
points come and
go four
[Music]
all and two hours shant just sending off
a racket to get
rung better be
quick it's been interesting I we had
what 12 breaks of serve the first two
sets and now in this third both players
finding a way to hold on
is this way madon has got to just find
some serious
self she would have felt that was a lost
opportunity those two break points
no just stay plugged in in the moment
and focusing on this game and on this
next Point
here it's so easy for the mind to start
racing a little bit more just things get
