love 15 I think the biggest question of
the 2024 season was uh the return game
of Ben Shelton we know how great his
Serv is it's certainly an area where as
far as return points one were concerned
he was quite low down there on the
list that's going to be so important for
him this evening
[Applause]
[Applause]
both with some exceptional numbers
behind their surf but a little bit of
trouble here early
doors so many of these great players
speak about the nerves in the opening
couple of games of of any match they
play That's when they're the most
susceptible
what do you make
of the way it looks the changes he's
made from the platform to the step
up yeah the step up I'm unsure of I
never had it myself so I I I I don't
know
how some players are not suited to it
others are and a lot of coaches like it
more but there's been some great players
that haven't stepped up like this but
the end result is that he gets into a
great hitting motion
yep and it's consistent it it's accurate
it's big and it's consistent so I have
no complaints with it at all
it's probably a Ser that doesn't quite
have the flare that Shelton does but his
is one of the better going around now
then Shelton and and and yanex is too
but the
left-handed the addition of the
left-handed angle really uh makes
Shelton probably a bit more
Awkward early opportunity here though
for
him two break points for
[Applause]
34 so I think just the nature of Ben's
game Robbie is
different it's different to uh sin sin
will give very few of those easy points
away he's a little more up and down Ben
isn't he from the back of the Court he's
got so much flare and he'll he'll hit a
lot of winners but um that was a poor
giveaway that one
go box off his spin with the early
break cent of course was lost broken in
the eighth game of the second set
against H garuna in the fourth round so
it just shows you how difficult it is to
get the better of the Italian and it
took something
special it wasn't a good start by C
though he barely made a first serve it's
seemed and he was a little tentative in
the first game so you got to you got to
hand it to Ben though he came up with a
colossal forehand to break took his
opportunity when it was there early and
if you have a look at the win predictor
here very much in Sinner's favor of
course he leads the hit to hit 4 to
one Ben Shelton to Ser one the last four
meetings Shelton won the very first one
in shangan on the quick what's
there h
just to give you an idea of how well
he's been playing the big points on
return this week a season average last
year for break points converter was
37% I can tell you in the tournament so
far it's up to
44% that's a huge uptick when percentage
Point here or there can make a big
difference
we know he's going to serve well almost
a given
Fitzy that second serve was a beauty
into the
[Applause]
[Music]
body seeing that American flag there
Fitzy yeah absolutely he got a he got a
forehand there though that he should
have put away that's where he's a little
bit erratic at times Ben
[Music]
yep speaking of Americans delighted to
have another great surve 1 Co
commentator Ryan Harrison said sitting
Courtside first of all a warm welcome
and give us an idea of how things are
down there and of course from American
perspective huge match this evening Ryan
yeah great to be with you
guys yeah listen Fort side it is great
serving conditions that will help Ben
Shelton there's not too much wind the
slight breeze is downwind from where
Shelton is serving right now we got the
lights on it's still a bit Sunny so it's
not too dark overhead but really good
conditions so
far 13 14 you know his game well and to
me it seems that if he misses a lot of
first serves though Shelton he'll be put
under pressure because he C won't have a
problem getting most of his second
serves back with some depth and then
then they have to trade some ground
strokes and you've got to back the
Italian surely when they're both
back well that's exactly right fixie if
he's getting a lot of free points on
serve he's dangerous and that's the
whole game behind Ben Shelton he wants
to apply pressure on your game while how
quickly and swiftly he holds serve
andage
[Applause]
sh just early on you're seeing Center
just a little bit unsettled a little bit
of erratic he is not usually making
these groundstroke errors so just still
trying to settle in and Ben is doing
well to capitalize on this early
opportunity got a quick Glimpse there of
Ben's Uncle Rick
Witkin this comes from the tennis family
we know his a fantastic play of Brian
but Lisa of course his M A Witkin we
remember Todd who so sadly passed way
and he carries his
uncle's name as his middle
name I think is
awesome it's certainly a heavyweight G
pool of tennis Talent isn't it from both
sides of the
family there's Brian on the on the right
there that's Ben's dad and of course I
played against Tod Witkin way back he's
a little younger than me but um he was
one heck of a
player yeah we miss him his his brother
Rick can't miss him on the right there
Lum is a real
character loose fors I'd like to see the
back end of this game sooner rather than
later just of course his dad had a a
Stell coaching career let's not forget
that initially at Georgia Tech where
Brian won the NCAA championships with
the women's team
[Applause]
there before winning it with the Florida
Gator the men's team of which Ben was
part of that winning team
I think the left-handed angles so far in
this match have thrown cant he's gone to
the forehand and given Ben Shelton a
running forehand on a couple of
occasions and it's been a mistake so
against a right-hander that's the
natural angle he would go with
here maybe better to go push that one
back down the line deep and make Ben hit
the two-handed that's dangerous if you
let him run at that forehand
[Applause]
game Shelton I think that reaction tells
us a lot the importance just sub menting
that early break Shelton leads two games
to l
yeah Fitzy one other thing I think that
the Ben Shelton foot speed is a bit
underappreciated court level here when
you're watching his first step and the
way that he recovers back into the court
when it appears that there's open space
that Gap closes really
quickly he certainly a good athlete
isn't he I mean
it's it's obvious
big tall young man and quick as
well yeah so if he's going to go to that
forand though Robbie he really has to go
hard I think and and get the ball away
from Shelton if he gives him one that he
can reach and run
at gee yeah you FL flirting with danger
yeah you want him to pass you off your
back end there his weaker
side as you suggested on that low pickup
big difference when he gets that first
serve into
play he really gave Shelton an
opportunity in the opening game to and
probably a little nervy opening game
where he allowed him to get involved in
the rallies a bit too much
4
L this one his very first major 12
months ago right
here book end of the season winning the
US Open to go with the Australian
Open game cner that's a much better hold
Cent's on the board but he's down a
break
early 21 to the
[Music]
American we know B shelt's got one of
the biggest serves in the game but what
always like to dig a Little Deeper to
find out why the Shelton
serve might be a little bit better first
of all we can see he gets great leg
Drive the ground reaction force is
phenomenal and look at the serf speed to
232 km hour that is ferociously Swift
but why is that the case well I think
it's so important you're having a look
at the biomechanics of a serve and and
the leg drive that is measured in me/
second the average here at the AO is
1.84 and you can see a big step up for
Shelton he is almost 16% more leag Drive
than everybody else in the field and
that's why his average serve speed is
quicker and his top end is almost
Untouchable he's already been broken
once today and if you have a look back
at how well C has been serving he has
only been broken maximum of one time in
every match that he's
played that's how effective he has been
behind his serve and he's going to have
to protect it going forward now can't
let Shelton have the luxury of a double
break Shelton serving a
2-1 love 15
it's a little bit of an enigma isn't he
his forehand
because if you let him run at it it
scares you cuz he can he can hit a
winner from anywhere but then he throws
in some Mish hits a lot of free points
from that
Wing fif in all but it's because his
serve is so good Robbie and he's hard to
break the forehand becomes more I think
it becomes more dangerous and more scary
CU if you lose your serve
mhm at any stage it's hard to break back
that's where cner finds
himself and I think Ryan we've
definitely seen the evolution of the sh
Ser I remember when he first came on the
scene he was just Kenny Po's fast ball
every single
time yeah I I think that's a great point
because at this level someone like
Center if it's just only the fast ball
especially over five sets he'll get used
to the speed so the variety has gotten
way better for Ben
[Applause]
thir and the thing that's most
impressive when he uses the variety is
even when the speed goes down he keeps
the acceleration through the ball very
quickly and so that ball jumps off the
court in whatever Direction he's
spinning it
134 logic says though if he gets
involved in too many rallies from the
back of the court it's hard to see how
he will win more than 50% of those
points Ryan I I I can't see it maybe you
might disagree mate I'm Keen to know if
you do
but even in the early stages here when C
gets the ball back deep and gets
involved in the point it seems like the
pendulum turns in his favor
let gee that that serve would not have
come come back from so many of the
players on what a return that
was two games
all yeah fit what a return there from
Center and that's the challenge of
playing someone like Center where it
doesn't come back against 99% of the
tour but with Center you have to hit
that one extra ball and I think you hit
the nail on the head there with Shelton
not wanting to get into too many
extended rallies early on you see him
going to the slice backand after the
first or second one I think he wants to
keep that spin variety to try and
prevent the rallies being
extended 15 I think the bad news it's
not big bad news but I think the bad
news for Brian Shelton right now is that
c has not played his best tennis yet and
he's found himself back in this first
set so he'll be feeling quite boyed at
this moment
for pin Brian would like
to did I say Brian apologies right well
I know Brian I know so well it's
difficult you know played against him
admired his game offered to pay a lot of
money for his
serve you're not the only one
was just having a look at the Baseline
points one for both players apart from
the first match that Shelton played 15
based on points one he is in the 40% all
the way through 43 41 40 and against
Loren Lorenzo Sono he won
42% of the Baseline rally Center and
contrast is in in the
mid-50s again it's a big differential
you know if I hadn't just looked at the
stats 14 I would not have guessed that
sin's already got 62% of his first
serves in to me it feels like it's about
40 that's that's surpris me so he I feel
like he hasn't served great yet
cner and he's capable of it
second let
second there no lit machines
so the CH umpire has to call the lets as
John did
there
403 Ryan did both players there question
that let call by John
Blom they both had a little bit of a eye
raise look up and see if it was
definitely a l and they and both
conceded that it was a little unusual
that they're not using the net devices
this year yeah I think it was last year
as well Ry at the magees only
[Music]
well for the first time in this match s
will sit down getting a little bit more
comfortable he leades three three games
to two
[Music]
[Applause]
I didn't read gentleman that the company
that makes the
machines that
detect the let has actually gone
bankrupt and they're not producing them
anymore
that reports and effect came from um
think was Lindsay
dport was suggesting that or one of the
American
broadcasters that's an unusual one yeah
that's good inform I was just going to
ask if that was due to some misfiring
from the net devices or if there was
another manufacturing reason for that
because I think we all can agree that
those net devices were welcome in some
of the situations where it's hard to
tell one way or the
[Music]
other all thanks to insurance
and Melbourne and all her
magnificent as we start to enjoy finals
weekend here the woman's finalist set is
already An American in there Madison
Keys flying the flag high for the USA
Ben Shelton would love to join
her the men's Sunday
[Applause]
final but he's got an navigate this guy
someone who has been there and done it
two majors played in 2024 in the finals
two we
[Applause]
converted 15
1 15 there was a bit of Ryan Harrison
behind that volley seen that before Ryan
that was a a strong compliment I think
if I had that volley in the tank I might
be playing a few more years
he's certainly going to have some quick
games on this serve isn't it it's just a
natural phenomenon
really well not a phenomenon actually
it's just a natural way of being when
you have a serve this good there'll be
some quick
games go back Bo please
than oh wow he's starting to open his
shoulders a bit isn't here this is
different to the first game or two from
the back of the Court 43
he manhandled that second serve with his
forehand too by the way
so to me it's not an easy ball to return
so easily with that left-handed kick
coming at you but sinner seemed to be
having no trouble at all with the second
one
ju starting to feel the full force of
the world number
one guys just watching this first Ser
centers this Ball Toss is getting really
low for Ben
Shelton is that a natural occurrence for
him ran I mean if he gets tight does the
BS get lower
normally yeah I think the tendency for
big servers is is when you want to try
and get that free point you want to hit
the ball as quickly as you can and you
don't let it get all the way up
he's cut from a different clo is the
world number one
defended well initially and right there
changes the whole dynamic of the rally
with one rip of the
forehand to me Robby he's starting to
get used to playing the left-hander you
know right-handers don't play
left-handers anywhere near as much as
left-handers play right-handers in this
sport of as and the angle can confuse
you for a while but it looks like he's
starting to feel a bit more comfortable
center from the back of the Court
I can tell you fy since the start of the
2023 season and Vantage s s's won 11 of
the 12 matches that he's played against
lefties the only guy to beat
him I wonder who is the man that he's
facing today but so far so good that's
when Shel beat him in Shanghai the very
first time played during the 2023
season s with a another chance to
break let's
it's a magnificent first delivery isn't
it well guys Center did have the luxury
of not having to play against one
particular left-hander
[Applause]
s's got play near field as
[Applause]
wellage to wor about
that love the creativity here from
mean the balance and the slide was
gorgeous
another chance for centner
the water point from
Shelton using the full dimensions of the
tennis
quarter well I've I've got to admit I
thought CER played almost a perfect
point I thought he was going to win this
halfway
through and this was
flirting very close outside edge maybe
of that
line he gets away with it Shelton but
what a point from both
players it's not often you can bring the
world number one to his knees but
Shelton certainly did
that Advantage Shelton
[Applause]
an annoyed look of C to the far end of
the
court I think he should be missing that
back in one of the longest service
games that Shelton has experienced in
the
tournament G shuton that's a hard hat
hold Dan happy
[Applause]
three games all speaking of
Americans talk talking about defying the
odds today C is on a 17 match win
streak against players from the USA so
not only is he enjoying playing against
lefties but Americans as
well well I think every nationality
would have been suffering a little bit
at his hands over the last couple of
years is particularly in 2024 yep Ben
Shelton's having to work hard though
he's had three service games they've all
been
difficult holding up well
[Applause]
15
L of course yanic sna before the match
against hogar Runa in the fourth round
World Cup feeling very unwell
bit of stomach
problems and the match against the day
was a battle royale warm conditions he
was struggling big time
somehow and managed to go
to the depths of what he had to find the
win bounced back superbly against Alex
deor in his previous match in the
quarterfinals be keeping an eye on how
he is handling the physical battle today
Shelton's making him work hard
I think this is a prime example of of
matchups in tennis you know if you
compare Alex demon or to Ben Shelton
here for yanic sner they are totally
different
propositions demon or plays from the
back of the quarter lot and and cner
really had Alex covered as he does most
plays as he's a right-hander and he hits
the ball in his slot a little bit and
but Shelton is a completely different
proposition the Lefty the big serve the
flashy
forehand creates different problems for
him
14
15 well 50 you're exactly right and
earlier today I was able to have a short
conversation with coach of yan Center
Darren Cahill and I said well done the
other night and he made it a point to
say that he knew that this was a much
different matchup so to your point the
center team very well aware of that
yeah no matter what way you look at it
Ryan you know Ben Shelton's going to win
a lot of matches in his career not not
just because he's an extremely good
player but because of the of what he
brings to the table in terms
of being so
different the left-handedness of him can
confuse a lot of right-handers you're
well done on that first Ser percentage
of
today and that can be because it's a
different angle here he's serving to a
left-hander just throws your Rhythm a
bit at times
[Music]
game s the very they find way even if
he's not on top of his serving game just
yet sad four
[Music]
gam just scan the code for your chance
to be next you win experience courtesy
master
and now there's a guy that can drive
Robbie I think that is Oscar pestry he
is he's from he's from Brighton in
Melbourne one of the best driv in the
world right now the
youngster managed by Mark Weber by the
way sporting royalty in the
[Music]
house Australia's F1 driver at this
moment there's been a couple of them at
late of
late Oscar pestry it's got pretty good
seat
he must know some people
[Applause]
FY uh there he is the great Mark
Weber I wonder if he knew he was on the
screen give us a wave Mark next
time 15 l
[Applause]
of course I know George Russell from the
UK loves his tennesses often see him at
Wimbledon
Queens do you think they'd be impressed
by tennis players
reactions reflexes or would they just
think H that's nothing
we need a contest of some sort with the
lights tennis players versus F1
driv a few years ago with his charity
here in Melbourne had the F1 drivers in
about March when the F1 is here in
Melbourne and have a tennis
program over at Albert Park close to the
track okay where a lot of the practice
courts are for the Australian
Open there was a few that could play a
bit
mhm there was a couple that should stick
to driving okay I was a big fan of his
of
course seems a real character well Fitzy
a lot safer for the F1 drivers to play
tennis the tennis drivers to go drive F1
yeah yeah I think I'd trust them more
with a racket in their hand
Ryan that's better than most that oh
that's a heck of a volley I thought he'd
given C too too good an opportunity
there to pass with his forand he hit it
straight into the forehand Wing here I
thought he'd be in trouble at the net
but he reads it well and executes it
beautifully these new balls here would
be helping the serve No Doubt
he's being made to work extremely hard
behind his ser and of course San alluded
to the start of the match was going to
be important for Ben to to try and hold
comfortably build the pressure on
Yanik Shelton's already faced break
points in his first three service games
game sh doesn't have to worry about that
this time round but still only a 30
hold G and I think that wide one to the
second court for the left-hander there
is helped by the new balls that it
accentuates the swing to a degree and
that was a perfect finish to the game
[Applause]
so this is when things start to get
interesting for
all getting closer to the sharp end of
the
set 15 left
what do you think not a bad play for Ben
Shelton there to tee off on that backand
at
times yeah I like it I think Ben is a
good disruptor what do you think Ryan
yeah I totally agree the more he can try
and play these points on his terms
instead of these long back and forth
rallies it'll be to his
favor 3
love lead service games one
in the tournament Center such an
improved shot came into this
encounter winning 96% of
those server's got
paer it's got more
accurate well two great here but I've
got to say his first serve percentage
has taken a dive it's down to around 40%
it's not enough so he he's needed a
couple of good ones that he's produced
in this
game can see when he gets that first
serve any wins 80% of the
points game c it's more like K starting
to find his Groove is the world number
one s five games to four fans are happy
and why not
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
some match to cheer four for both of
these tennis
[Music]
Nations time
I was talking about the fact that
American tennis is really coming on in
Leaps and Bounds especially on the men's
side of things
now Ben Shelt Taylor Fritz of course
competed in the finals of the US Open
against Yanik
CNA this is tiao back playing some good
ball Tommy
Paul Brandon nashima had a good 2024
season R AEL his back he's always
dangerous
15 similarly Italian tennis very much on
the up and up has been palini lighting
things up on the woman's side last
year was this guy flying the ill TriCore
for his Nation beautifully
[Applause]
thir cha to me continues to be an enigma
and he probably always will be Ben
because he he at times he rallies
beautifully doesn't he doesn't look like
missing the ball and then all of a
sudden he will throw in three or four
wild forehand that Miss by a long
way oh second serve bomb
that had some heat on it bit of parate
Technic tennis there for it's still the
fastest one he's hit all
tournament and went at the
body what a
delivery Chin Music
game sh just what you wanted to tell end
of Bo opening set a love hold for the
American five
games of course when you look back
historically it's the head-to-head
between these two there's always been a
TI break mixed in
there as won most of them
there the Fest
serves today so
far these guys can crank it
what things mixing things up
beautifully love
15 well guys one of the things one of
the things you want to see whenever
a guy like Ben Shelton's played against
the world number one is what does his
attitude and demeanor look like does he
look like he's just out there and seeing
what the world number one does or is he
taking it to him and to me it looks like
he is fully embracing this opportunity
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
this is a half chance
here that's what you're talking about
right
for yeah I mean if if you're in the
center Camp your heart's in your mouth
when he gets a forehand in that part of
the court
because first thing he's going to do is
hit it hard and and if he hits it into
the position he wants it's either going
to be a winner or almost an UNR
returnable so it's a dangerous shot y
but yes he then dumps it in the net at
times 11 un forced error off that
particular side
15
Fortune not sure Shelton was meant to
hit the ball that high I think it had a
bit of hack spin on it from the miss
it but it's worked out well
[Applause]
broke yanin his Opening Service game of
this
match what a time if he could break
now he got two
chances game Shelton a super tennis from
Shelton and he gets a valuable break in
the 11th game and he
will for the opening set
the Simplicity of that point fit off the
making the return no fancy approach not
trying to go for the outright winner
there no but he had he had CER so deep
in the court didn't he I mean he played
a a great game there in a
typical Ben Shelton type game where he's
dangerous he yeah he made it an error at
uh at 1540 didn't he or or sorry at
earlier in the game but but then the
love 30 point he hit the point in but
this is dangerous because look how deep
Center is yeah but my point is he hasn't
gone for one of there he knows just with
the hook Cross Court yeah he's looking
for a two shot combination I like that
he
patient trusting his Net
game and this is a a mentality that
occurs because you're you're playing
against a player with such a dangerous
serve you know you can't make any or too
many errors on your own serve or you get
into
trouble
time at the majes the Americans have
struggled against Center they're 0 and4
but I tell you what Shelton is making
some good Headway here he's broken
center for the second time now
and would love to close out the opening
set with a couple meaningful first
serves 15
now win that first point on
serf chances of holding go to about 89%
and if you got to serve as good as
Shelton's 89 is the average you're
looking at about 91% for someone who's
as good as Ben
15
all a lot of Defending in that
rally good peripheral vision from
cner too
easy on it in a
Flash 15
[Applause]
1 so difficult to defend against the
down the line parsing shots the most
direct way past an opponent
oh huge Miss huge
Miss goodness mate that might cost him
the first
set and I tell you what if you can Li
read a little bit of Italian he was not
happy with that
Miss contact there wasn't thin enough
you got to brush up the back of the ball
so
finally we's got to be ready for
that it's been a good play a couple of
times Shelton's hit the second serve One
Flat like a first serve and then that
one straight at the
[Applause]
body what an impressive set of tennis
this has been from Shelton arrived at
set point
well s's given him the full run around
in that
rally that'll test the lungs
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
f
practiced in the art of
deception and Shon
[Applause]
got what he wanted
[Applause]
there absolute Beauty
[Music]
I'm I'm not sure I mean it's part of his
repertoire isn't it the drop shot but
I'm not sure against
Shelton it's necessarily the play it
brings B into the net where he's quite
comfortable if he doesn't hit that drop
shot perfectly he can either rip a
forehand and he played it to the forand
Wing by the way
still hard to hold serve against though
isn't he and Vantage
[Applause]
C
Shelton faced break points in his first
three service
games he was under all kind of Jess it's
more of the same
now what a
bonus what a miss you I can't help
thinking and sometimes it's just
psychological but against a
left-hander you tend to struggle with
the angles a little bit and I think that
causes some inconsistency we've seen
cner in this first set Miss balls that
he rarely misses I just wonder if that's
the the
[Applause]
matchup I mean I don't mind the seven b
at all from B in fact I love it
but C was clever enough just to block
the ball low and ask the question
another break
point game
c what a cutting
Fox finds a solution six GES all
TI fighting off two set points on the
shelter and
serve and once again these two will
contest a tie break
Fitzy in the previous five meetings
there's always been a tie break
involved Shelton has to put that
disappointment quickly behind him and
and it is a big
disappointment settle down please thank
you
one Z forehand might be his undoing
when this opening set is said and done
forit it's just hemorrhaging unforced
errors now yeah but you live and die by
the sword don't you I mean it's it's his
dangerous weapon to in the in the middle
of these rallies but if it deserts him
for just a few minutes it can cause
Havoc both players with good success
this year at the
AO oh W to
tiers that's that's a bad Miss there
guys it's really interesting these for
hands that he's missing are the ones
that he has a lot of time on the one
where he has to run and react and just
hit an amazing passing shot he's
fine 16 of those bad boys now
what a turn around this
is when he had set point there serving
for it you wouldn't have picked this
[Applause]
[Applause]
4
Z sinner
he's one the L six points in a row now h
s momentum firmly with the world number
one Ben just bounced his
racket not happy at all perhaps still
thinking about those two set points on
serve that he had
well he's he's gone to Pieces here
really I mean he's played so well with
such variety such danger he's caused his
opponent and all of a
sudden the form has just slumped
he's still in
it Ryan but do you think he was just
playing on the edge maybe a bit too much
in this F like it's the way he probably
has to play against the world number one
but all of a sudden it sort of exploded
in his face
here yeah I think for the majority of
the first set he was doing a good job of
mixing up those opportune times we saw
his net percentage of points one was
really really good early on he was using
the slic backand and also using a
variety of spins getting the ball heavy
up with the forehand and it seems like
since he lost that set point opportunity
the second one he's just gone full on
Haymakers each time
[Applause]
C well it's tough to tough to judge
these world class players sometimes or
easy to judge them really sitting in a
box up above the court but sometimes I
wonder about Ben shot selection if if if
there's a question Mark for me he's such
a good ball Striker and a dangerous
player but he does give away a few
points with the wrong choice sometimes I
believe but it hasn't been that in this
tiebreaker it's more that he's just it's
basic stuff that he really basic he's
just blown his forehand
here me when puts it all together
[Applause]
I mean this first set for C now is like
absolute gold I bet he feels like he
hasn't played at his best and and he has
stolen this first set if he closes it
out
C two set points and wins nine of the
last 11 points to steal the opening set
from
Shelton he wins at 76 in the time
break even further now playing from a
set behind set number
two 15 left
[Applause]
15
all sort of strange for me watching B
here and he was pushing the envelope a
little bit with some of his forehand in
the first set but they look so safe
compared to the last 10 minutes he just
doesn't look safe
anymore 1
[Music]
15
maybe subconsciously he was pushing the
envelope a little bit you know red
lining that's a better one didn't
overplay
that didn't take too much risk to
achieve that reward and there's his dad
ironically laughing I would think or
smiling thinking where was that the last
10 minutes Ben was doing the same
great retrieving 14 1 all the great
players defend well don't they
yep kept the ball alive and caused this
that for has just not calibrated well
enough today
well s showing us why he's number one
yes scrambling that serve back
deep and he knows that if he gets into
the rally he's
favorite you're well below 50% now on
Baseline points one for Shelton to your
point
Fitzy Advantage
shelter 20 out of 58 for the American
that's a lowly 34% of the Baseline
points one
well I was about to say then Robbie that
he he desperately at this moment or in
these moments early in the second set
has to serve well and get some free
points on his first serve because at the
moment he is not
winning when he gets involved in a rally
usually after a second serve so and then
CER also returns a great first serve
back as well
[Applause]
Advantage so impressive defending
Center and Shelton running out of places
to go with that forehand
[Applause]
Point ruthlessly efficient
neutralizing the sh Surf and then
sending the American from coast to coast
at will well Robbie I I feel blessed
sometimes to sit in this box and comment
on a game that I love but it's hard to
comprehend for us me Immortals how good
cner can be that game was such a high
level under pressure
just creating unbelievable pressure back
on on Ben Shelton here and maintaining
that level wow that was
good so good as Ryan was suggesting just
putting meaningful returns back in play
you can see for the AO Shelton's first
serves un
returned
39% today it's down to 28 that's a 11%
dip off against Center that's how good
yanek has been at getting the serve back
in play
oh he 15 love I mean he hasn't turned
this match on its head
yet but there's been a huge momentum
shift hasn't it just from 10 or 15
minutes ago Center has been almost
faultless
out
15 come on he missed one well guys one
part of tennis that's not talked about
enough is making your opponent play
poorly and I thought that early on
Shelton was doing a good job of keeping
Center on his toes variety of spins
shortening points getting in the net
he's going to need to do a bit more of
that 1 15
guess one it's hard not to think that
that was the opportunity that Shelton
needed to capitalize get the opening
set I do feel that Fitzy was suggesting
that c could only play better from here
on
in yeah that's see at the line and we're
starting to see his true
[Music]
15 I can't help thinking it was the
left-handed
approach from this young man that really
threw Center in that first head he he
wasn't quite himself and to Shelton's
credit by the way he was so good until
he got to the stage where he had set
point on his own surf
second 403
[Applause]
[Music]
boat
surpris if we want to look at both sides
of the co sh also said I well gentlemen
I couldn't hit my point any worse than
what I did in the opening set that too
is only going to get
better well it did there
[Music]
[Applause]
hey
spe oh
and VY
Shelton well well well
yeah a hiccup
[Applause]
is
can you believe
[Applause]
it oh against
99 out of the top
100 would have been good
enough but the number one player in the
world makes you hit the ball just a
little closer to the line
[Applause]
well if you're going to win these
matches you need to make those balls
break point a golden opportunity
missed Advantage C
[Music]
oh now it's sin's turn
well he he just seemed a tiny bit
fatigued at the end of this long rally
Yanik now I think under normal
circumstances would have been there a
little quicker Robby
[Applause]
but yeah one that you would expect him
to make in the
end give Shelton some credit there
it's proper ground stroking from
both such good
quality either player able to apply the
finishing touches at the
moment
Advantage
C ladies and Gentlemen
please don't do as that f that don't
call out during the S thank
you well down John blond it's been too
much of that I think this
year game cner crucial game wasn't it
wasn't a just let
see CES two games
to always hop on about how the very best
in any sport just find a way they're not
playing their best tennis when they go
through a game like that if you're yanx
Center just to get the
hold to save the two set points in the
opening set just an extra ball in the
court the base level of play is it's
always just high
enough
L well Ben Shelton still
has this great trick up his
sleeve if you will the fact that he's
dangerous every single point and he is
always hard to break
15
[Applause]
love well FY I think the most important
thing is that he has the belief and so
even though he's down a set in a break
he still shows that signs of
fight thir
L and he is going to need it just to
give you an example of how important
that first set is last on Hardcore when
he won the opening
set he went on to win 86% of the
matches oh hello 1
[Music]
[Applause]
15 keep the change out of that
yep of course when he loses the opening
set on a hardc court last year and wins
30% of those matches
so he's going to have to defy the odds
in a big way
today see what a return mean the first
serve was
excellent he's got great anticipation
it's not just foot speed and getting
into position and then the hand eye
coordination it's it's the anticipation
also to read where this serve is going
not easy
[Applause]
43 as soon as Yanik went down the line
with that wide forehand he was in
trouble wasn't he just open the court up
for the natural left-handed hook
forehand from
Shelton
yes well that
can that can cause you some problems if
you if you just have a mental laps there
pen obviously thought it was going long
but just wasn't disciplined enough there
to make
sure that bit
lack of discipline
might go a long way to hurting his
chances another chance for Senator break
in the
set game c stunning
s's got the double break and he is very
much charg of proceedings now in the
second of the men's single semi-finals
it's three
zip he landed that he was able to get on
that return was exquisite
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
here we insire
[Music]
CH well m park in all her
glory as we walk into finals weekend
here of the AO 2025 Kon of course the
defending champion
and he was very difficult to beat last
year you tell you went undefeated
against players outside the top 20 in
fact not a single player straight set at
him last year he won at least one set in
all of the 79 matches he played only
Roger feder in 2005 had managed
that 15 now so well he's been playing
Eight titles dominating on hard
courts and Robie if you look back at 65
Shelton serving in that opening set if
you if you think about
it he's broken three times straight yep
and he's won the tiebreaker
mhm and now he looks like he'll take a
for love lead
shortly he's off and
running GE it happens quickly
let seconds
for Ryan and I being a little critical
about that uh just lack of discipline
there at at juice in the not juice it
was actually his ad I think 4030 in the
previous game on his serf I mean I I
just hated to see that because I just
felt like that opened the door for a
great player and the great players won't
do that they won't give you an easy one
like
that I guess it's part of his FL Ryan
but but gee that that it worried me a
bit
you're exactly right when you're playing
a player of this caliber at the top of
his game you can't afford to give him an
inch if you just look at the clock we're
at an hour and 37 minutes and in about
an hour and 5 minutes Ben Shelton look
to be in control and that's how quickly
things change whenever you play against
someone as Relentless as Center so you
really can't give them
anything 15 l
[Applause]
thir l
[Music]
1 15 it's probably also good to offer a
bit of perspective as well when realize
how green Shelton is been playing for
that long has he yeah yeah exactly I
mean that's important to
remember still so much upside
30 his first trip abroad ever outside of
America to play competitive tennis was
here back in the January of
2023 I mean it's it's unfathomable he's
got so much to learn hasn't he what what
a talent he broke the top 100 by just
playing in America and he did it quickly
as
well 4 30
[Applause]
well guys I think that the important
thing for Shelton is if you're looking
at his potential growth he's already as
good as he is with so much he can still
improve well Sid
[Applause]
course we keep an eye on the return
points one this season ran Shon last
year won just over 32% of his return
points won at two a level the average
amongst the top 50 was 37 that has to
improve made some big improvements
this fortnite in that
department and I bring that up folks
because it's such a major
barometer of being a top 10
[Music]
player those return points one have got
to get up to about
35% for Shelton the only outlier who has
been below Shelton's numbers to get to
the top 10 is John Isner we know what
kind of serve he's
got very much the
outlier game
sh well he's on the board in the second
set just's got a double break
[Applause]
[Music]
one was Pride day today here at the
Australian
Open those guys are good in list to them
all
[Music]
[Music]
weak talented artists
around time
it's a very colorful Rod Laver Arena on
Pride day here at the AO and somebody
who's been using H his full
pallet of colors is Ben Shelton even
though it hasn't always worked out for
him he's been using the slice
intelligently it's helped neutralize a
lot of points but just making ter many
unforced errors not capitalizing on his
chances that's why he's down to set in a
double break
and if you're joining us for the first
time today I can tell you that he had
two set points on his own serve in the
opening set at 65 couldn't convert had a
PO TI
break now he finds himself in a world of
hurt get the best player on the planet
[Applause]
15 in all
to believe it just a couple of days ago
against Huna he was almost dead on his
feet the third game of the third set
poised at one set all at 37 shot
rally to save break point against
hogga could be a major plot point in the
outcome of this year's Australian Open
1
[Applause]
15 well guys I think it's worth
mentioning that a lot of these mistakes
that Shelton is making is because the
movement and the ability to go defense
to offense from Center is so strong that
you feel like you have to be so perfect
with that putaway
ball 15 point taken I'm so right he he
defends aggressively yeah and with the
best of them he defends so well with so
much balance and he can convert a
defensive situation into a an offensive
situation so
quickly you do wonder how much being a
good Scare at a young age contributes to
that balance and that sliding that both
him and Novak have dynamic balance is so
good of course novc enjoyed skiing as
well when he was a
Youngster s was a top skier in Italy
when he was a
junior you any good in the slopes
Robbie you you better below PA but I
love
it game to good
[Applause]
c fishing rod in your hand aren't you
yeah yeah I think I'd be seated in that
department if we had a major oh you're
getting cocky now he you're the one that
was building me
up I try not to go for any new
activities that could leave my life in
danger so the ski slopes and anything
like F1 driving I I stick away from I
I'll stick to the golf H come on yeah
this is no time for modesty Ryan
15 left
[Applause]
31 he served in voled three times guys
is
that too few for somebody who's got to
serve like
this well for me I think if he's a
servant volley this particular
returner who happens to have a number
one next to his name M I'd be going at
the body a fair bit yep unless he can
hit a cold
Ace if you want to ser and volley go to
the body try to jam him a little bit and
then you can maybe get a floating return
rather than something that's drilled at
your
feet I don't know about you guys
but when a left hand served to me to the
forehand and it had some work on it and
it would
kick away from you I found it really
difficult to time the ball on that first
return CA it it's like picking cherries
he's coming straight out of the middle
of the racket virtually every
time even that
return 1 14 and it has gone pair shaped
quickly hasn't right yeah absolutely and
thing that's so impressive is that
Center when he is fully stretched and
fully lunged he still finds a way to get
that ball in the middle of the Racket
and get some depth on the
return set point Center
juice
Advantage Shelton
game
Shelton oh finally an ace for Shelton
those have been far
between fifth for the match unle Rick
still hob is
[Music]
H really interesting here guys Ben
Shelton just talking to chair umpire and
I believe he's is asking for the physio
on the next change of ends or the set
break I can see the chair Empire going
to the phone right now couple points ago
looked like Shelton kind of reached down
and was looking at either his right hip
or his right quad and it is possible
that he's going to be getting a medical
timeout or an evaluation for that on the
next change
events yeah good
information I I
think for me I my first thought Ryan was
that it might he was flexing his right
knee but maybe it was the hip but the
knee come to my mind but there's
something there
time got a piece of art right there
tennis in the second set's been a work
of
ought serving for a two sets to love
lead 15 love
have
I understood that
Ron yeah we had a overhead fan that
uh had a
little wanted to get a little ligher on
his feet well we have some seagulls here
at at night quite often in this area and
they they're attracted to the
lights third she the tennis not too bad
either well why wouldn't you be
attracted to the
tennis first tennis mage of the year of
course he's staying up late way past his
bedtime but for yanic it's worth
it 40 l
[Music]
serving moner CLA in the second set from
Yanik three set
points G and second set well embroided
the six with his beautiful brutality he
takes a two6 to lead
versus third set Shelton to
serve let's see how this third sh set
shakes
out
15 almost 15 in court for the
American a 12 and a
half over the Italian coming into this
match
oh 15
all well guys if he's going to make his
way back in the match he's going to have
to use his transition game he can't just
continue to stay back there and try and
blast winners cuz Center just defends to
well
1 CH 15
14
15 tell you once
again order to defy the ODS if he were
to get the win never come back from two
sets to love down has
Shelton still a young career though
game
sh and that forn was
threshed first game third
[Music]
[Applause]
set guess Ryan if you could have a quick
word with been on the change of ends
here what would your advice be to him
going forward from here on
in well first of all you've got to look
at what you were doing to start the
match that was throwing Center so off
balance because I think we saw Center in
the early stages he was making way more
mistakes than we're used to him seeing
and I thought that that variety of spin
that he was using on his backhand slice
was doing a good job of mixing that that
slice then hitting the one set up and I
thought that he was doing a much better
job with his depth of ball I think that
gotten a little short with some of his
return uh return locations he's got to
get a little better
depth love 15
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
wow what a forehand you need so much
Spin and
control you need rad to produce that
racket head
speed this
is magnificent modern forand
[Applause]
[Music]
help
15
1 let see that's the variety I like to
see right there using that Lefty
forehand getting the ball up using the
variety with the slice and you just see
Yanik have to change the direction in
which his racket head is coming through
the shot he does so well absorbing power
so you've got to continue to mix up that
speed and spin
oh how good was
that
anticipation Exquisite again from C
thir so much work to do on both
occasions well he he's not quite as
polished is he as Center yet Ben Shel
and he saw the funny side of that but uh
give him a couple of years I would
say and of course this match is not over
so let's oh let me not get on the front
foot too soon but but he's just a bit
loose with some of his shots yet and
when he learns to polish that
up boy he's going to be
dangerous I'd love to get an early break
here at the start of the third Fitzy
that's the type of ball yanena will not
miss second serve plenty of
time it's a tough School tough gig out
[Music]
[Applause]
here just been too many basic errors off
the record of Shelton in important
moments
[Applause]
advantage cner
[Music]
[Music]
that's more like
K sent on that occasion
unable to get himself out of trouble
[Applause]
yes almost think that slightly more
controlled approach just gave him a bit
more time to get set at the net Ryan
yeah most definitely and I don't think
this Aussie crowd wants an early
night especially given that they had an
early
afternoon jovic retiring after a set
against sasz verev the first
semifinal
no Advantage Cen
to
G
CER he is just so Rock
Solid well he loved
it kill out of his chair Marco panichi
just behind Darren in the same color
top strength and conditioning trainer
worked with Novak for many
years was Sim votti on the left he was
the one who took over when s split up
with Ricardo Piti who really did Lay the
foundation of the beautiful game that c
possesses was with Ricardo for many many
years we should all send our regards to
Ricardo wow what a what a coach he's
been yeah no
kidding we got a pretty good coach
sitting on the side of the court tonight
too Robbie o
I've
noticed a good combo Darren kahill and
Simone I was think I was talking about
Ryan
Harrison cuz I'm I'm still ke to I'm
wondering if the only thing left here
for Ben Shelton Ryan is that maybe he
can throw a few use that chip to try to
bring Center forward a little bit on his
backand wing or just make him move
forward a little bit at times to take
him out of his comfort zone slightly I'm
not sure where to go here for
him cuz he's having to hit a shot like
that to win win points from the back of
the Court the
[Music]
25 well FY I appreciate that knot of
confidence and you're exactly right
these points were just bashing of the
ball you just favor Center in almost
anyone's matchup so Ben's got to
continue to look for his opportunities
to take it to him and use that little
short chip would be a very effective
shot
he's having to play an extraordinary
point isn't he from the
back but he's done it twice this
game oh a little bit of filthy feel at
the end of it as well 14
15 filthy feel these people are loving
it right now from Ben Shelton he's got
them on the edge of their seats they are
ready to erupt for this American
[Applause]
man I can see the change of depth with
that shot
Exquisite game
Shelton it's a strong game from Ben
Shelton leads two games to one well
three games in in the third set two one
it this
[Music]
just scan the QR code for your chance to
be next you could win a experience
courtesy oft card and
the I think one of the differences as
well for C excuse me for Shelton from
the back of the court is having to to
deal with sin's ready placement this was
set number one you can see 177% of sin's
ground strokes in the yellow zone but
look what happens in set to much better
depth and you can see those pulsating
balls testimony to the improved depth
from Center and of course pushing
Shelton further and further back and of
course in those Baseline rallies he's
struggling against the world number one
he's only winning about a third of them
moment Center was able to keep that sort
of length he just suffocates you into
submission time
[Music]
all record
crowds the fortnite so
far and some of the Day Records they
aren't by a couple of hundred or even a
th it's 5 6
7,000 more fans in some of these day and
night sessions what an AO 2025 it's been
oh stop it
Ben love 15
[Applause]
I mean that should be worth a bonus
Point given the quality of that you're
pushing that agenda aren't you this week
Robbie it's amazing that counts the same
it's just a basic unforced error
love 1 well he's lighting it up again
all of a
sudden Yanik okay there physically he
looks like he's walking a bit slow I
noticed it a couple points ago when he
was coming out and he was looking like
he was a little slow walking and he just
looked at the bench over to his team and
he muttered something I couldn't quite
tell what it
was yeah he did win there once or twice
F
153 course y now you got to keep a poker
face
can't give
Shelton anything to to Feast his eyes on
if he sees that c is struggling that'll
boy him that'll give him more energy
won't
[Applause]
it and he did that so well against Runa
did SNA
oh he's got
cramp just so struggle there for a
second
Fortune just saw the leg straight there
you
go yeah guys I think Shelton saw it on
the big screen as well so he's now aware
of what's going on over there and if you
need any reason to stick around down two
sets it's to see your opponent
struggling
physically Shelton with two valuable
break points
stunning top tier tennis right there
134 I wonder what I wonder if it is
cramp and and if it is seems strange
that he would get it after two
sets is
[Applause]
it is it left over from two from two
matches
ago when he was feeling physically a bit
down
[Music]
yep do you think it is cramp
Ry yeah I'm I'm saying 95% it's cramping
it looks like he's not trying to show it
it looks like he's going to try and see
if he can manage his way through this
third set he's still on serve and as we
saw last Point free points on serve and
short points will give him the
opportunity to recover a little
bit Yeah Shelton Who spend more time on
court coming to this contest almost two
and a half hours
more Advantage Senor I mean when you see
that now guys you just think about those
two set points that Shelton had on serve
at 65 when he was serving was he was he
rubbing his quad
inside his pocket
there not
sure it just looks like there's a lot of
concern on his face I couldn't see if he
was going inside his pocket or not but
it does look like he's very
concerned okay s sa
long ch
new balls
please let's see if sen says anything to
the chair umpire or
not it's always interesting to me do you
run the
risk it's the marks that you get from
cupping take away any of the impurities
in your
system just just wonder is that what
happens if you leave the cramping too
long before you request the physio to
come out you run the risk of it getting
too
severe and the massage comes too late I
always wonder how you find that
Balancing
Act do you get the physio out sooner
rather than
later like to get your that knowing what
you've been through in Long
matches well one of the things you want
to do when you're cramping is you want
to try and be strategic with how you
exert your remaining energy for that
time
being 15 that makes it extremely
important for Shelton to build a lead on
these service games of his if he's able
to get up 30 love 40 love 40 15 you'll
likely see Center not really running
full for the remainder of the
game 15 30 it's cheap I think of it it's
like charging your phone you got one
charge do you decide to do it when
you've only got 5% left in the battery
or do you try and do it when you still
got 11 or 12 that would be would equate
to the physio coming out and looking
after you
he's he's not get position quite as well
little less
balanced to
me starting to spray a few from the back
of the court for now
just such an awkward PA
well I don't think B has played this
game tightly enough he's given him a
couple of free points here not
necessarily that last one but he's
opened the door hasn't
he and a big way
fitsy yeah that that hurt didn't it
right yeah he just pulled at the
hamstring and stantly he's definitely
cramping in that left hamstring now I'm
absolutely
sure you can see it there yep grabs the
hammy straight away
[Applause]
boys well in a way let's hope
and not a tweak in that hamstring if
it's if it's that it's a it's a real
problem yeah good
point oh the the ups and downs of trying
to win a grand slam singles
title that was a pep play that worked so
well against Lorenzo Sono in the
previous round going down the line was
Exquisite tell you what he's he's
trading a fine line though Ben isn't he
with a shot like that to save savy serve
[Music]
well that's a major body blow right
there from
Shelton and guys now
at his right quad hip flexor so he went
from left hamstring grab to right quad
hip flexor and absolutely leaving
everything out there in this game trying
to see if he can get the break and get
up an early break knowing the importance
of trying to finish this out in three
now
[Applause]
Deus
[Applause]
[Music]
out
Advantage CER
oh my
goodness game
cner how important could would that game
be in the context of this match CNA
digging awfully deep to take a 3-2
lead oh it's a fine line between being
brave yeah being Reckless yeah well said
and the physio has did come out now for
Center and this be
regarded this won't be regarded as a
full change of ends because it's
considered actually
just identifying the problem even though
we know what the problem was so in
effect a play gets one identifying
change of ends that's what Paul N is
doing now and then he'll get two full
further change of ends of a massage for
cramps if
needed ATP physio just been on
to to exent a rub for cramps
and the first time you get it done fit
is considered it's an assessment even
though he's come on and done it straight
away so it's not a full two change of
ends it's O just telling him to get a
rub so there was an assessment plus half
a change of ends he will
get further full change of
ends if he needs
but everything on the edge right now I
mean Ben Shelton's down two sets in a
break and he just doesn't quite know how
close he is possibly to winning this
match and from it sounds crazy when you
say that eh yeah but given what we're
seeing yeah we don't know what's going
to happen here yeah
and from sin's point of view he really
has to play some faultless tennis here
to try to finish it off he's got the
break in the third but this is not going
to be
[Applause]
simple particularly if Ben can rally as
solidly as he possibly can keep the ball
in play extend the points a
bit everyone on edge here
wow vaporized that four Ander Center
fora boomi at 168 km an hour
that one's not coming back and he may
need to take more risks like that I mean
he's good enough to hit them in isn't he
but that's leaving on the edge a little
bit
a back burn through the air to
Two showing us that he can bring the
heat of both ground
strokes just the hold he needed
[Applause]
love 15 well he's decided to up the anti
it looks
like take a few more risks and back
himself here
[Applause]
L if you're Shelton you got to try and
get the ball out of the middle of the
court because anything Center can get
his racket on right now he's absolutely
cracking
let's
F oh that's a good bit of
Fortune that's got a lot of work to do
la 14 well he's he's just turned it on
this is a sign of a great Champion he's
under durs here and everything he's done
in the last 10 minutes since he was
cramping has turned to
gold and helped a little bit by Ben
Shelton going the wrong way there on
that volley seven points on the bounce
now oh my goodness
what a gift yeah two games in a row C
lead to two to serve his way into a
third major
final well FY to your point earlier in
the match I just don't understand some
of these decisions for as good of a
player Ben Shelton is already I go back
to that two all do second serve and he
goes for a 3/4 almost second first serve
there and double faults just before
getting broken and to me if I'm seeing a
guy laboring on the other side of the
net with those long points mounting I'm
trying to just play as many physical
points as I can again and again I don't
understand why you would shorten up the
points and go for massive second serves
it only helps your opponent to play
those short points even if you land one
it's not going to do any long-term
effects on a guy who's cramping so I
just don't love love the strategy behind
playing against a granding opponent in
that way yeah I agree I agree so that
sery hit but you mentioning the second
serve originally to go down break point
was well over 200ks an
[Music]
hour only one other player has ever
reached more than three major finals one
Italian and that of course is the great
Nia Petra
Angeli cting to reach a third Grand slam
final it's one decent service game
away 15
L was both Jasmine palini and Francesca
skoni both been to two major
[Music]

thir to
all 2 hours and 35 minutes this one has
been
ongoing and it's been a match about
moments and Ben
Shelton will be ruin those missed
opportunities the first two set points
that he had on serve at 65 in the
opening set but since then s sin's been
the
one it's met at
13 he's made the right
decision chosen the correct
shots just yeah managed his game better
Fitzy
[Applause]

match
point game c mat Cena it will be a third
major final for y
