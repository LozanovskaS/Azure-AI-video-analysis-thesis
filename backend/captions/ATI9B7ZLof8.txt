40
love straight up to speed here jovic
with some good accurate first serves
45 think of all the shots
at we've analyzed of novx I think the
Ser has been working the best this week
which is always a good sign so often
lays the foundation for players
this there's the wind that you can
see novx back
there's no doubt the serve for
jovic is what's played a a significant
role in the longevity he's had his
ability to manage matches he showed it
in the previous two rounds two dangerous
check opponents in mahat and leka once
he gets ahead just keeps the scoreboard
tick him with know good accurate serving
minimizes the pressure that he faces on
his own serve
and been a very important number as the
UN return numbers pop up on your screen
first game you can see a 10%
differential and probably a good good
time to go down to Roger rashed cor good
evening Roger how's the atmosphere how
conditions yeah good evening electric
atmosphere huge anticipation a
heavyweight fight the conditions were
always blowing as you said from now from
alcaraz's in and it's it's really picked
up through the night very heavy gusts
come for come into that from that side
and they go deep into the backhand
corner with Novak as well that is a
tough end to manage ALR has his strength
when he's up that up
power no would have the luxury of been
able to swing freely knowing that he
it'll be hard to hit the ball deep but
that's this is going to be a tricky
night on the tennis court boys because
it's very blustery this we haven't seen
this breeze so far the Australian
Open thanks Raj Carlos
[Applause]
love well straight away jovic reminds us
of his ability to make opponent
play that one extra
shot that surf doesn't come back against
most players
[Music]
the hardest part about this is for out
is is the ball as it's coming towards
you it's dying in speed so you need to
be you need to be you need to be meeting
that and matching it we've seen that now
on two occasions he hasn't been able to
deal with the ball pulling up so
[Music]
significantly yeah and in the wind when
it's Breezy you know footwork is at a
premium and at the start of a match like
this if there's any kind of nerves
sometimes it's the footwork that
suffers maybe just in impacting araras
those two Miss
forand for a
service see a lot of communication
between one Callis Ferrero and his
charge
hello what was that
well it's the
first point in what could turn into a
very long highlight reel that is a
ridiculous volley from Carlos
alarz and not even Novak jovic could
track it down
30 a point like that could be so
important in the outcome of an opening
set right well it might allow allow him
to hold surf here y the difference
between 1530 and love 40 is significant
down one again getting a spin control of
course has been tinkering with the serve
parity 14 also
been just fine tuning as much as he can
he wants to make that shot a little bit
what what changes do you see from 2024
call
it's another Miss for hand and there is
the
break so it's a slightly slow start from
alar maybe just the breeze the
conditions getting the better
of well with regards to the alar serve
you know why has he made changes first
of all looking for more consistency
looking for more accuracy MH and he's
aiming to achieve that with a more sort
of relaxed fluid motion a little bit
more load into the right leg but also a
longer sort of motion with the racket to
take away the pause that was there in
the
serve looked okay there but it was the
forehand that cost him the
game please
speaking of his forehand that epic match
they played finals of
Cincinnati in 2023 it's one of the best
matches I've ever seen two out of three
sets nothing in
it jovic saved a match point in the
second set went on to win 76 in the
third longest ATP final in history two
out of three
sets was the four hand on that day that
just leaked too many unforced
errors and players who have had success
against
al tend to get some Joy when going hard
and deep to that forehand and I think
the depth control of jovic is going to
be very important this evening
153
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
of course new coach on board as
well your good friend Andy Murray
brought into The
Fray and brought into The Fray for
exactly this type of match to try and
help jovic to try and give him an edge
to beat alcarez to beat
sinner to win his 25th Grand Slam
title L for the order of the day so far
304 and is that an indirect title if he
does get there for
Murray given that he came unstack here
on five occasions four of them to
Novak johnes for alcarez to break back
up
G it's
mesmerizing big to play on a big time
point for Marez to get back on
trip jovic leads by two games to
one look at this smile that's why we
love this guy so
much he plays tennis with real passion
and
joy and of course that's the first time
that he's had Joy against the excuse me
against the jovic serve and we'll
explain why when we come out the
break the first Long Point of the night
wasn't it Robbie and
uh it'll be interesting to see who can
win the majority of these this evening
arz was just biing his time thank for
eventually pulling the trigger on a
magnificent
back Frozen rope all the back
[Applause]
here of course when they played in the
Olympics in Paris last year
caros sarez had eight break points and
he didn't convert on any of them tonight
he gets
one and he makes it
count we spoke about the maximizing of
the moment for both these players they
are so
clutch who's going to take the
advantages who's going to make it count
when it matters most he said a
ridiculous pickup volley as well as a
backend that is
it's other
worldly those winners count the same as
the unforced
Eris yeah five of them on his forehand
now needs to
find the Rhythm and and just the feeling
on that
shot calibrate the gun
oh 15
all here's a look at the serve look at
the the racket goes down it used to come
up a lot quicker and the fact that it
goes down makes it a longer motion and
the pause is pretty much gone
now against n in round two there were 14
aces in three quick sets it was an
impressive suring performance but
there's been some double faults
throughout the tournament as well and I
think it's fair to say this is by far
the biggest test of that new service
motion this was just the fourth time
that he been broken in the tournament 14
alcarez coming into this match it's
saved seven of the 10 break points that
he had
saved excuse me that he had faced
boys the one big thing for me in this
match is we talked about the serve but
also AR has patience through the rally
we know he burns a few balls gives a few
freebies because he loves the creativity
of the of the tennis cour he wants to
paint a such a creative pcture I know
that they've been doing some work the
AR's camping actually keeping more balls
in play with flight and bounce and
picking your right moment and that will
go a long way in this match as well to
not give those free fre points that's a
good point keep the creativity of your
mind as well that's a hard
balance a sh of 16 years the get between
these two as you
saw Australian Open fact pop up
it's quite extraordinary what they both
doing at their respective ages of course
Carlos the youngest ever world number
one on the men's side
[Music]
unvarnished that time off the
forehead well I think it's fair to say
he has found the
timing combination of the two forand
here and look at the speed of that
winner 164 km an
hour everything into the ball doesn't
get much better than that boys that was
against a heavy Wind by the way
let remind ourselves we mentioned the
changes to the surf but about 5 G of
weight added to the the throat of his
racket with a view to to beefing up his
game as well Carlos
sarez certainly saw it in that for hunt
unfortunately there's no bonus points in
our sport so that spectacular for down
the line it's not a three-pointer counts
for just the same as those missed
backhands and
forehands it's the beauty and brutality
of our scoring
system that's a
beauty 4
1 of course Roger he became that the
world youngest number one taken over
from your good friend didn't he he broke
record Lon hu South Australian of course
someone who Roger coached and mentored
for many
years use
[Applause]
[Music]
well that's what jovic is about you know
there'll be some ey catching moments
from him for sure
but just the tennis
IQ smart decision to go back in behind
alarz who we know is so quick to cover
the Open Court just catching him off
balance
there Game T of
it deadly accurate yen is happy so for
the fans 32 good contest so far
[Applause]
[Music]
already a couple of w moments and this
was one of them sure dropping
pickup
time great Freeze Frame you can see how
far he makes contact in front of the
body on that
return it's day 10 of the Australian
Open 2025 men's quarterfinal action wi
earlier today for Sasha spev over Tommy
Paul and Sasha will be sitting back in
his hotel room watching this one
unfold he needed four sets to get the
better of Tommy earlier today
15
love even esar Kimu our chair
umpire the most experienced in the
business
w
what happens there 15 well that was
just a little out of syn that forehand
didn't quite get his feet into position
we mentioned that F being premium in the
breeze but look at the way he's reaching
for contact there that tells he was out
of position didn't get the the body
angles right for the shot he was trying
to
execute thank you ladies
[Applause]
and please
tennis player put that one two punch so
very well and alar has his turn here to
go back in
behind it's a great combination jovic of
course sprinting to cover the Open
Court keep an eye on the serve plus one
for both
players I'm interested to see
thir not just how they the alcar first
serve performs tonight but the second
yes it's cooler at
night and For Me Maybe Roger can give us
a bit more of an Insight but it's not
going to jump as much he's got more of a
a sort of kick second and it's not going
to jump it's not going to get up on
jovic so maybe a chance for the great
man to step in and attack
Roger fa to say the ball probably not
jumping as much in these conditions
obviously not as much as the day and and
also with the breeze coming from behind
him it's also I guess pushing it forward
so it's not allowing it to to jump up
but
um yeah no you know he's he's deal
they're dealing with the breeze at the
moment boys it's actually trickier than
you think they make it look pretty easy
to be
honest we'd be all over the shop right
now
hey leave me out of this
one Lu is a jovic had missed long I
certainly think
so I think it was his third shot of the
rally no wasn't sure about the serve
either a little earlier on in this
game but it was the case there wasn't it
second serve jovic stepping in and on
top of the point from the get-
go it's now two from six second serve
points one so far for
alcarez excuse me two from
Seven he has no one trip part this guy
has got so many
skills one of the best Drop shots of the
forehand side a lot of players a good
feel of the backand but his feel on the
forehand
Exquisite he didn't invent the drop shot
did he but he's the current owner of
it you'll see plenty of those tonight
sure yeah just to back up what you were
saying about the second serve points one
tonight and jovic won that deciding set
in Cincinnati in that epic final and I
used that because there was conditions
probably the most similar to what we're
experiencing this evening in the
deciding set alare has only won 39% of
the points behind his second serve and
it cost behind the players please thank
you big drop off from the previous two
sets where he was in the 50s
15
[Applause]
love 30 love
Randy
Murray played alarz a couple of times
both in
2021 one one L one in fact one Carlos
fero he's played Marian
jovic there's a myriad of head-to heads
out here on the court
[Music]
Mar beat Ferrero three times three
consecutive tournaments 2009 4 love
colos did actually get a win over Novak
jovic was all the way back in
2005 wow just four years after Carlos
alros was
born
astonishing bit of tennis royalty in the
house
well he's one of these guys that
possesses what I call nuclear
athleticism especially on a hard court
you're going to be soy of playing Drop
shots he's an explosive athlete that's
for sure and it's it's big Dynamic
strides isn't it up to a short ball like
that look at that probably four steps
there he's covered the ground
took of
It new balls please no back at the
steady H to lead 43 first by four games
of three
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
it's match already
starting to settle into a
trend very difficult conditions and as
Roger said these guys handling them so
impressively see more winners more shot
making from the racket of
alarz the master tactician just working
away efficient with his tennis as always
[Applause]
that's one of the reasons why playing
outdoor tennis is so
encouraged awful maor outdoor
events yes we have the roof if we need
it but got to get used to playing in the
wind dealing with the elements you can
grow up in those conditions it always
[Music]
helps I think we just saw the big
difference so far for me at the moment
get balls back off the return and and
Carlos hasn't yet found his returning
Rhythm enough balls back in
play one of the great strings of Novak
right engaging You full time
[Applause]
15 just to your point just getting
caught out here anticipating the wrong
way to your point
roaj 40% of jovic's first serves have un
been under turned for alcarez it's just
26 and that's a smart return because a
reminder jovic has the wind at his back
here so even that sort of block chip
return is just going to going to
maintain it speed that little bit longer
downwind
almost caught alar slightly off guard he
was late on the forehead
he's under a bit of scoreboard pressure
here in
Sp when he won the US Open the first
time he became world number one how much
he was serving in voling he was using
that heavy kicker a lot in New York with
certain volley behind it I remember in
this match against Center over five sets
I want to say he came in 58
times I was so good at bringing that
forand of the drop shot into play after
the first serve 14 13
the grip change right at the last
second incredible
disguise the first bit of frustration
from no Novak
jovic what is going to be tested you're
talking about
the we're going to see what the Novak
coach in group get with Andy as well
this is going to be his legitimate first
test when there's a heightened level of
anxiety throughout the course of the
match of certain stages and how their
interaction their interaction plays out
I think that's quite an interesting
watch when heaviness of Al as you can
see he's got a bit more on his what
Novak has I think he's going to enjoy
playing the wind given a heart he likes
to hit the
[Applause]
ball
genius what
Vision what Vision but what movement as
well 37 years of age has anyone ever
anticipated better that's the key to it
he's moving for that shot just before
alcaraz has hit it allows him to make up
the ground and he's got the the skills
to push it past them
rob you a spot on when you said Al will
love these conditions up the other end
because of his strength and natural
power he's able to muscle the ball
through the breeze and you can see then
just pushing no back out of the Court
that's it's not easy to do from where he
was in the court big Plus in this match
I think as it goes as it goes through
the hours
uh
the Alchemy of alcarez on full
[Applause]
display of course the drop shot into the
wind is so effective
15 you know that just pulls up
after that forehand flies past him and
he also may have called the trailer out
as well by back I think he did speak to
the
chair now he's missed it
[Applause]
just missed
it the realization only just setting
in for the vast majority of the crowd
now so nice support in here for
jovic chance of no late no
l thank you ladies and gentlemen
enough of thinking
well I think he's annoyed
because he have expected that you know
the homework is done they know jovit
likes that faster second serve to the
forehand in the bigger
moments he was trying to move in we've
seen him really attacking second serve
taking them early this tournament
alarz just slightly Mish hit the
forehand there
[Applause]
looks like a bit of a wounded warrior at
the moment
jovic moving gingerly between points
[Music]
[Applause]
advantage alos
has
RAR not Novak at the end of his range
right
now and it's not comfortable at all for
the 10 time champion
patient
persistent and a bit of perfection with
a back
in another incredible point the way
alcarez is moving
but the quality from jovic again back in
behind doing the
trick not even alarz could touch that
one you could see how much he brushed up
the back a short abbreviated swing to
impart the spin on the back hand and
that one got Andy Mario on his
feet Mr offing the RW of the call the
rent
perhaps a means of buying himself just a
little bit of time off that lowest point
what a great adjustment that was on the
return went back deeper on the second
thir return Novak throws it in a loopy
flighted ball and Carlos uses strength
from back there to start the
rally it's better than most that back
hand it's another body blow for
jovic to face another break point
he's just about to all
SK whether you like their
tactics ocura standing deep to return
the second C or not I like the variety I
like both I like showing jovic different
looks and almost trying
to attract different types of second
servers out of him rather than letting
him dictate to to you as the
returner and of course we know akarz has
the skill set to do both not all players
do not many do he's going deep in the
court again here for this second serve
let's see what jovic throws at him
and when you return from that deep what
is the skill set required you've got to
be able to generate a lot of pace and
height and therefore depth on the return
to push the server back then move up the
court and look to take control and
there's no doubt alar possesses that I
almost don't like it when he comes in I
don't like that aggressive stance
because I think that quick second serve
of novx is so effective he's already
caught C out a couple of times you just
take that option off the
[Music]
tablez Rock
Solid okz gets the crucial break in the
ninth game and will serve for the
opening
[Applause]
six let us Inspire your next adventure
like it's going to be an off Court
medical timeout for
no I think he
was just pointing to his adductor area
grin absolutely and as if we needed any
more connections here we've got Roger
feder's old
physio treating jovic right the
connections are endless Stefan
[Music]
vivier brilliant tennis from
alarz jovic hering but it's the tennis
marz it's got him in
front stti on vivier there twoos
just taking no behind the scenes
because guess it's the groin that's an
issue
so it's a sensitive area probably going
to need a shorts taken down that'll get
done behind closed doors
just that constant
jaring the full slides in the splits and
and he's had some intense matches he
lost the set to basar he lost the set to
Faria but you know alarz is consistently
taking him outside the comfort zone he's
pushing him to the very limits you know
physically into the corners and maybe
he's just feeling something here jovic
let's hope that he can
find some comfort physically and uh it's
not going to hamper him in this matchup
he's going to need to be at his very
best in terms of his
movement CU this guy will stretch you to
every fiber of your
being what an athlete I mean how strong
is he in his
arms like a pit bull isn't he
and he's somewhat of an
anomaly when you think of his
height you know not as tall as uh some
of the other players bursting onto the
seat not as tall as a cner not as tall
as a ver that's for sure you know these
players with the sort of uh longer
stride length but he is as quick if not
quicker and just about everyone in the
game
yeah it's a bull that's not too
dissimilar to an adal's right ra wasn't
the tallest guard but he was just you
know Rippling with
muscle I think raford probably had a
maybe an inch or two on him height wise
but not an awful lot
mhm a few the players these days have
that long slender build not too
dissimilar to noov is now receiving an
off medical timeout Center fits into
that
mold urz listed at 6' tall 183
[Music]
cm just a reminder that jovic giving
away 15 years and 349 days tonight in
this match
[Music]
up ex wife yena and that's his agent on
the left Mar Madden
of course charged now
with thinking about no's future and
preparing him for Life After
tennis working on multi-year deals and
sponsorships of course rumored that
alcarez his new sponsorship with Nik was
in the region of $200
million Colin's eyes have just closed
it's a pretty good bit though he's
played in four major finals and he's won
four well he's a a global Superstar
isn't he that transcends the sport of
tennis not just because of the way he
can play the sport but the way he
carries himself his personality is
charisma we've already seen him the the
smile that he plays with even in a match
of this
magnitude and of course the the big
Brands loved
it penny for Andy M's thoughts at this
stage must be well just hoping as much
as anything that jovic can find
some physical comfort and be able to
compete the way he wants to
here on the right there in the white
track suit
isz his oldest brother Oar ever
present of course uh his younger
brothers playing some good ball at the
moment in at the big tournament in
France yeah essentially the under 14
World
Championships ha that's right and if
you've seen any video of social media
the forand is identical he's a he's a
clone isn't he it's a carbon
copy Mini Me of his big
brother see that BL left thigh is taped
now strapped up saw a of white
underneath
it
[Applause]
TI thank you
serving for the opening
[Music]
set 15
11z has made a very healthy 69% of his
first surfes
to love
[Music]
love yeah the
uh the work on the serve in the
offseason working in this opening set
certainly in terms of the the
consistency the percentage as you say
Robbie three set
[Music]
points out the first set and he puts
himself in pole position with his first
love service game of the match
good stuff
64 and Grand Slams when he wins the
opening
set and of course the trivia question
for this game
is who is the
one that's what we want to know when
alcarez wins the first set at a major
he's 55 and one in his career
that was a little bit of Panic it's
unusual for
[Applause]
alarz 30
love well anyone at home that's getting
the answer to that question Robbie it's
uh seriously
impressive oh kid
for service 2021 here in
Melbourne second
round we'll wait two more points
shows you what an incredible
barometer warning the opening sets in
the outcome of
[Music]
matches games up of eight
that's a good hold from Noak in the end
and before you tell the
answer just to highlight the importance
of winning the opening set for somebody
like
karez and if he loses the opening set
he's n and 10 huge difference right this
is 55 and
one and the one
is a sweet yep
Brothers yes it's the younger of the two
Mikel
imer who was 95 in the world at the time
aarz was 141 he'd come through
qualifying and qualifying of course that
year taking place in Doha because of the
co
pandemic 15
love but I think the first set so often
just shows you know well who's playing
the better
tennis who whose game sort of matches up
better against the opponent but then
also of course at a best of five you
know look at the probabilities here aarz
now has two sets to win jovic
three and you would think certainly all
the Talk part of this match was the
longer it goes the more it favors
alcaras so there's no doubt he's in a
very strong position here and we may
well see jovic start to to look for more
of that stepping in attacking looking to
shorten points
so you could theoretically argue that
after an hour of tennis jovic has got
nothing to show for all his
effort still got to win three
[Music]
sets and keep in mind that he spent 3
hours and 15 minutes more on the
court than what alcarez has
to
[Applause]
[Applause]
it's not easy to find this guy's
backhand on a return he's so good at
dancing around it and using his forehand
with the first
shot SEC second serves are so valuable
for
Novak well that combination has been
deadly so far look at that
100% of the time tonight after his first
serve when the Returns come back into
play alarz has been hitting his
forehand so jovic just cannot get the
ball away from that shot we know he's
been blocking chipping a few returns but
he might have to be a little bit more
adventurous try and get it into the back
G
G certainly coming after the second
serve in this game I think you we going
to remind ourselves we've seen Noak with
some body issues right throughout the
course of his 10 wins here and he's
still been out to find ways of winning
hasn't he so he's very J in these
situations good
point well how about that for getting
into the back with the first s
return just clubs a winner
[Applause]
harez hasn't faced a break point since
second game of the
match game
it's the same
result as The spaniard's Opening Service
game he gets broken joov by two got the
early
[Applause]
lead an adjustment already from
jovic the pain he's feeling in his leg
forcing
him to play bigger more attacking tennis
and it did the trick
there thank you to
[Applause]
this for me is a shot that Noak jovic
brought to our
sport where there may have been a
defensive sliced back hand in the past
it's now an open stand sliding
two-hander and alarz has mastered it so
is
s what a pass there
[Music]
[Applause]
well you talk about tennis and Legend
he's got a lot of it and already he's
making some adjustments some important
ones I want to say that's the first Ser
volley we've seen on a second
surf first we on any serve from
jovic as I had a couple 15 definitely
finding ways
to to be more offensive with his play
and to shorten points
here 14
15 another serve that seared the line
thank
[Applause]
you 4 to
thank you ladies like a serve but St
when the players are ready to serve
thank
you so deep in the court the ball's
actually got a lot further to carry
often see players hit that one in the
net
chov had a chance to approach the net
there but I think he was so wary of the
pass that alar has hit earlier in the
game he chose not to
[Music]
H and how good was the hustle from uh
Carlos and that's what I'm talking about
just staying in the point yes he might
have been out to pull the trigger on one
of those but that's the picture you're
want to see from if you won call perrero
thank
you
please advantage chov
back
[Applause]
G it's a lovely foray forward stefon's
happy he likes the four Court Activity
three zip for jovic chov by three games
love
[Music]
[Music]
well there's been a lot to Feast our
eyes
on in the opening 70 minutes of this
one
time wonderful creativity especially
from alcarez but jovic has shown a fair
bit of his own as well
of
[Music]
three 15 love
as we saw Y in a world of hurt against
hogar Runa what a match that was
yesterday how we came through hogga had
an opportunity to put him away yeah
struggling wasn't he early in the third
set C's hand quite literally shaking he
was
dizzy wasn't feeling well at all and
just found a way to hold on to his
service games and eventually start to
feel better in the
match it's a survival act from the
defending champion
[Music]
[Applause]
I remember 2021 roer you were talking
about leads by three games to one
working through injuries that match
against I think it was Taylor
Fritz extraordinary match where he had
was it was it the abdominal issue yeah
he he he he t a little abdominal
mid-match he was two sets to love
up if memory serves and then lost sets
three and four you thought goodness me
he's he's done in trouble here yeah he's
going
out beat Fritz 62 in the
fifth also the match Robbie the pleasure
of being Courtside that evening with it
Rod La Arena was evacuated at midnight
that's right I don't think I'll ever see
that happen again I mean I guess never
said never but that was uh unusual to
say the
least the the curfew with regards to the
the pandemic coming into operation
he just has so many different ways of
playing and of winning points in
matches that's the great players do
don't they that's why he's been able to
succeed on all different surfaces all
different conditions you know windy hot
cold
indoors hard grass
clay really seen him up the attacking
intent in this set so far
he's contesting his 433rd
Grand Slam match today it's more than
any other player
ever Sur pass Roger F this
week please F at
429 this is nox's 433rd
let first
[Music]
service okay I'm not complaining about
you know it was
[Music]
or was 5 seconds
late
crazy was the but I stop I know you sto
because he stopped you stopped because
he stopped
was no machine this year
Robbie let's been called by the Umpire
and alar has feeling that uh even as
theakim was a little late there and
maybe reacted to
jovic yeah she she saw Novak not playing
and then decided to call Anette that's
his argument he's not disputing that it
was a let yep
[Music]
[Applause]
fa just going more prepared that
guy thank
you just the CLE Brilliance of the chck
return from alarz I love
it4 all the fire power that he
possesses it's the Nuance that I find so
attractive in this
game G
my that's a strong game from alz
back on serve
[Applause]
3-2 he's just beating jovic there for
Pace such an intelligent pass straight
up the middle of the Court hard it's a
decent amount of spin
just got that extra bit of quality the
ability to to break the jovic serve
doesn't he three times now
tonight time
here's Colin alluded to in the break NOC
broken for the third time tonight it's
the most in the tournament so far he was
broken twice in his second round match
against Faria
15 love watch how's the wind down there
Courtside now has it settled at all it's
still somewhat probably a little bit
more consistent without that heavy gust
I do like that first serve out wide when
you're going against the breeze because
With the
Wind coming down towards him it actually
even drags it further wide
well that was very uncomfortable the
movement into the
forehand Corner the ball from AR alarz
wasn't even that wide relatively
speaking that was really concerning
[Applause]
3 15 I can tell you folks that this is
an Australian Open second Tuesday night
attendance
record 31,000
people come through the turn Styles this
evening
it's well above the previous number of
just over
20,000 just testimony to our popular
this events become Colin 40
15 absolutely right and probably speaks
to how eagerly anticipated this
particular match has been as
[Applause]
[Music]
well for 23
you would think with the way jovic is is
moving and feeling at the
moment this has to be a must win set for
him
yep you know it's a very risky thing to
do to to real out great this
and yes
[Applause]
yes if anyone was going to come out from
two sets to love tonight jovic would
would be in the discussion but just the
man he's up against the quality of
opposition the intensity of the
match another massive forehand there as
he looks
to to find ways to be effective
I love it when no is
almost falling off his feet when he's
going
forward to hit his shots especially at
back hand he is totally committed to
that strike haven't seen a lot of that
and is opening four
rounds that was nice lent into that one
it's brought him a break point
[Music]
there
scious from alarz yet
[Applause]
again well most players facing a break
point and going for a drop shot like
this you'd say that is a a bad decision
a risky play but not this guy's just got
that X Factor doesn't he complete
Mastery of that
shot able to disguise the forand and
pick jovic off to finish the
[Applause]
job it's white to the forehand looks to
be giving him the most problems jovic
Advantage physically
[Music]
spe
up that's one of the toughest shots in
the book he got a Little Help from the
[Applause]
net I can't tell you how good that was
over the back hand Wing the back hand
overhead just the dexterity the control
of the racker had the
strength and yeah I completely agree the
little neet core just helped jovic out
enough
that's tennis Excellence right
there Advantage
alar is there anything this guy can't do
attack defense his power this field his
finesse he can
volley and he does it all with a smile
on his face
oh
[Applause]
the h
[Applause]
perhaps feeling the heat
Colin quite possibly we mentioned the
attacking intent from jovic look at the
average ground stroke
speeds in this second set up 9 km an
hour on the
forehand and up eight on the backhand he
is going for it he's getting after arar
whenever he
can let for service
I tell you for the make it out that look
like the quicker serve of the
night well not quite on the speed gun
203 but it was out wide to the hard
court wasn't it which sometimes doesn't
quite register as quickly on the the gun
21 is the quickest he's
hit I tell you what was probably the
best serve he's hit all night
considering it was to save a break
point I don't know about you guys but I
just get the feeling that if he can
level up here it's big momentum switch
in this
match how does he get that ball back how
is it possible off the return he knows
it he knows it was
special the fact that he touched the
ball is remarkable but it assisted the
most incredible defensive for from alarz
to hang in the
point
Al new ball show stopping in so many
ways
variety is
mesmerizing
and we the beneficiaries of this
beautiful
tennis I'm sure Novak's not enjoying it
nearly as much he's testing out that leg
isn't
he the way he gets down with this drop
shot he's into the shot isn't he
breathing on that thing almostly so
close to it in the field doesn't only
come from the hands it comes from the
legs doesn't it he playing it with his
full body the drop shot
[Applause]
15
love 30 love
[Applause]
4
love he's doing an Onre Agy here is
Novak he's just playing a little quicker
isn't he
just increasing his rhythm hopefully
taking alcarez out of the one that he
finds himself in that's so
comfortable try to change the tempo of
the match 15 did you ever discuss that
with any of your
players if they were playing well or not
R absolutely Robbie just you got to
create a little bit of a different
tennis identity on the court in those
moments
403 Course Rogers work with the likes of
Gore Fe Gregor demitro Lon
hu what a run by m f
here 38-year old
an important hold just keep his nose out
in front to lead 43 in the second first
set to ocz
[Music]
well jovic is not 100% here but he's uh
he's hanging around using all of his uh
powers and skill set to to stay
competitive he's got an opportunity here
to to squeeze alar slightly in this
service game it's B coming out to serve
34 defend off break points in his
previous service game
don't give up on jovic just yet that's
for
[Music]
sure course pal Bosa first up today with
a major upset taken out KOCO gof of the
USA
and Zev Tommy Paul entertained everybody
here for arena zalena and Anastasia
penov had an absolute Humdinger please
zabal Lenka tested to the nth degree
before coming through
15
[Applause]
[Music]
love and there it is again moving into
his forehand corner and love playing a
shot that really was uh going to be the
end of the point one way or another he
no interest in really recovering
[Music]
here fory love
[Applause]
okay four games over this is when things
start to get interesting
now it's the third time that alarz has
held to love
that was a clear message there from one
caros Ferrero wasn't it right here right
now I love the way he looks down when he
gives the message almost as if to say
I'm concentrating when I give you that
message you keep
concentrating what concentration
Focus sometimes
that no alar has a strong point
just the delay here is
uh water bottle is taken off
Court not really
sure and maybe not feeling well excuse
me so we uh thank you ladies and
gentlemen member of the the ball crew is
is feeling better ASAP
wasn't clean but it was clean
enough just coming back to the focus for
alarz you
know I'm a big believer that the
magnitude of this match the quality of
the opponent focuses his mind more so
than maybe if he's got things a little
more comfortable on the court think we
see less dips just because of the moment
and who he's playing mhm but I just
guess that's a given isn't it with these
guys when they play each other
everything
spikes their their their cleanliness of
ball striking their movement their
Precision of their hitting as well and
the type of point they play I think
because of exactly that
[Applause]
col there's a lot of seagulls around
love of them I think we might have had a
seagull deposit it was quickly cleaned
up
well threw something different there
alcarez 15 we've seen him have Su some
success deep in the court for the second
Ser return this was like a a crush and
rush in he came very nearly pulled off
the volley joov did well to fend that
off
that was RA
isk he did even better to to fend that
point off from alarz who just
continually makes things
difficult very tough shot there from
jovic made to look relatively easy but I
can assure you it wasn't
14
[Applause]
15 un returns first Ser has come down
quite a bit for Novak in the second
set was at 40% at one stage during the
opening stands that's down to 25 now
[Applause]
jovic leads by five games to four it's a
a stronghold from NOC didn't miss by
much but it was enough that allows jovic
to lead 5-4
[Music]
right on the uh 19 minute mark on the
change of ends Carlos said special drink
and if you noticed that in the previous
change of
events just wondering if it's something
that he
takes every hour and a half
just mix it with some of his
water all the players get a couple of
those don't
they he's got the different drinks
there get lots of requests from back
home especially my daughter Grace she
loves the water bottles tell you we got
a stellar collection Colin
and it's been highly entertaining so far
and we're not done
[Music]
yet jovic will be hoping that there's
plenty of tennis to be played still but
he does have a nagging injury of
sorts serving to stay in the set though
was ararez
wow what's happened there
Ro yeah he just got a little anxious
didn't he didn't get didn't get his feet
up to that ball at all this is going to
be a tricky game because I I haven't
seen any restriction with noack's
movement and you
can thank you this is going to be a
tough game for AR to get through
[Music]
well he tried to give that forehand more
height and shape alarz he did give it
more height and shape but in these
conditions and especially into the
breeze it
just kind of sat there for jovic and
didn't he take
advantage he's flushed this war
hand those are three returns I've
seen no back hit in this
match consecutive returns that was jovic
of old here gluing those returns to the
Baseline
thank you ladies and gentlemen jovic's
timing his maximizing of the moment is
unparalleled his three set
points
please how do you like that
a short stopping return game and just
like that it's a set of
[Applause]
piece talk about taking your moment when
it comes just steps in and crushes the
second serve
return jovic the master at just managing
the scoreboard he knows better than
anyone that he he doesn't have to win
every Point not every shot has to be
perfect I know he was broken back but
take care of your serve keep yourself in
front on the scoreboard and eventually
the pressure will build on your opponent
and your moment will come and when it
did he was able to take it Luke at the
winners for jovic I know alar has two
more there 1311 but jovic hit three
winners in the first set 11 in the
second he really up the aggression the
bit of pain in the leg forced them to
and we've got a match on our hands here
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
and now the
contest is balanced evenly it's going to
get a prickly bottom if it's not
[Applause]
careful 15 love
1
[Applause]
love 3 mm in we're told
[Music]
come on come on how has he gotten to
that
30
15 it's incredible speed isn't it and
straight line speed that was the thing
with jovic going crosscourt
there just ridiculous the way these guys
cover a tennis court
4 to 15 what a period of play this has
been
[Music]
[Applause]
43 wants to keep this momentum
going two points where he's just allowed
alcarez to hang around in the
game and S eight back to
juice Ju
[Music]
[Applause]
jovic I know you get a nice side on view
of this Roger but don't you think nov
could do a little bit more of this just
ghosting
in agree especially with how precise he
hits
his ground is
is
continuing first game
third what we've seen in the last 10
minutes reminds me so much what we saw
the 2019 final against the D probably
the best match I think i' I've ever seen
jovic play certainly in a final it was a
joke it was
[Music]
Untouchable Milan manovich front
left gby Phil grit is fitness trainer on
the right of course longtime fitness
trainer he took a break and now he's
back Charlie Gomez Herrera sitting next
to Andy
there a big game coming here for alarz
Robbie both the first two
sets jovic is Ser first just as he's
done here in the third and both the
first two sets alcarez was broken in his
Opening Service
game there another wonderful
return 15 love
30 love
left for service
[Music]
3 21 15
[Music]
[Applause]
her old
[Applause]
well jovic is
uh keeping the heat High
[Music]
here he's looking for four games in a
row for service
pure
perfection speaking accuracy
Ro and what about the left hand at the
end just to
that slight angle that beats Carlos here
nothing wrong with what Carlos did in
this point maybe didn't get quite the
direction he want on the approach but
still to be able to come up with that
[Applause]
use back behind play highly effective it
just to load all the weight on that left
leg of novx
[Applause]
vintage jovic
there thought he did a good back out
Cross Court and
return it with
interest Goodness Me is he hitting the
ball cleanly
now thank
you stefon's loving
it he's got him with the slower ball
there
175 kilm an hour AAS his average first
Ser speed has been 191 so really changed
it
up and that takes courage doesn't it on
that point not to be thinking how can I
buy a free one off the first
[Music]
hit that's the play isn't
it the Quad Squad enjoyed it
Advan alcaras
[Applause]
oh you get the feeling that's a very
important hold for caros in the context
of this third set as you alluded to
Colin one game old G the roll at no was
on he doesn't want to go down a break
there first time he's held for one0 in a
set just gives them a foundation breaks
the Run of games against them as
well just get the feeling that nov is
finding the length iners returns he's
finding that sweet spot in the strings
even better now thank you ladies and
gentlemen players are certainly of all
the matches that I've done of his this
is the best ball striking by along long
way
oh that's f
[Applause]
I think he's borrowed that one off
Kos they're best buddies
now seem to
be I'm a big fan of the the big second
surf you know just scattered into your
your variation anything that just keeps
the returner
guessing and then on with you Robbie I
think every second serve return for
Carlos he should be back 100%
100% so much more damaging from back
there I think he can be
oh
third 15 he is middling the ball at the
moment
jovic what an ambassador he has been for
his
country and fiercely protected of his
own people clearly evident this week of
course and he wouldn't do a postmatch
interview because of what one of the
journalists did
during news session please you felt he
was mocking his fans I don't care if
they mock me but they'll mock my fans
and of course the journalist had to then
apologize to
Novak it's added a bit of fuel to his
fire hasn't it I think it has
wasn't having any of it a very
principled
individual lead by two get 21 in this
third
[Applause]
set I don't know about you guys but I
feel like I want to take a pause now
where we are here we
go but of course you can't right that's
where you cannot I think a mere
mortal you rest up here you get broken
you need a snack or something Robbie you
okay
no refuel
Robbie get something into
[Music]
it well we can just have a look here as
the players change ends the alarz serve
placement and there's no doubt jovic is
returning very well now but alcaraz's
first serve percentage is healthy for
the match 72% but the accuracy could
still be better little bit scatter gone
with the placement there yeah and I
think that's why he's struggling behind
the first serve Effectiveness in the
second
set we've seen alcarez have a couple of
tough service games of late Ser doesn't
quite have the accuracy it's not as deep
in the
box and if you have a look at the
opening set he was warning 76% of the
points behind his first serve second set
only 67 I think that accuracy is
starting to hurt some now Colin it's not
accurate enough
[Applause]
love 15 Just Tennis intelligence right
there he loves to play those soft touch
games doesn't
he yeah there's videos all over the
Internet of jovic playing it's become
known as the jovic game hasn't it where
you got to bounce the ball on your own
side first in the service boxes but it's
all working on these soft skills ability
to manipulate the racket
[Music]
he's coming after the alcar serve again
here Spaniard hardly getting a free
point with his
serve he's the ball's coming fast off
his rack as you said right out the
middle he's in the zone right now
there's no doubt about that and Carlos
is finding it hard to find a way to work
his way through no
[Applause]
love the way he's standing he's been in
that position ready to return He looks
about 10t tall right now time violation
warning Al
[Music]
oh thought about
it obviously Carl is sensing the moment
there
15 just trying to take a little bit of
extra time but of course rightly getting
time violation even asakim Mo on it got
to be fair to both players thank you
momentum is with nov
yeah short experience Beyond his years
there alarz in just taking his time
taking the time
violation brilliant combination here
again of the drop shot crosscourt pass
of course if he gets another time
violation he'll lose his first serve
going forward
and if he gets this third
one just keeps losing the first
serve that's a forehand that has sunk
into his
[Applause]
strings I can tell you now that ocz has
faced break
points three of his last four service
games now it's going back to the second
it oh he had a decent look at
[Music]
it he loved that shot didn't he and he
knows that Noak jovic is more than
capable of making that one he knew it
was going there credit alar who hit a
pretty high quality shot but you
expected jovic to at least make him play
in that moment oh that hook forehand
crosscourt of
muris he paid for some nice Real Estate
in England over the
years that's a joke of a forehead
[Applause]
Advantage alaras don't forget Andy's
hotel in Scotland
Robbie Short Change of
heav
massively left for service
please
game well these opening two service
games of
cores been so
crucial two games old the very best they
just find a way don't
they yeah these are two very tough holds
of serve significant holds of serve it's
not just about the Highlight Reel and
hitting winner it's between the years as
well and this guy has shown real
character early in this third set thank
you ladies and 162 points played in
total now 81
all if caros who just can't get a count
can he can't buy that first point to
create a little bit of tension on the
Novak serve at the moment
he
[Applause]
30
love he's given the fake
there saw a few of those in the Legends
match a little earlier
today has taking mat as to his own hands
there with the crowd I think it's one of
his supporters because he just poor
favor asking for quiet please in
Spanish it's always as it to say I've
got this yeah let me show you 3 15 that
famous chat with Tony Nadal and Rafer
when they had to go for a
rain at Wimbledon Uncle Tony was so
nervous and ref had to say to him don't
worry I've got it the Epic against
Raj came back and won his first
Wimbledon uncle tney was
panicking Jo is in full flow
14
15 kept that volley nice and simple did
just enough to keep control of the
point he's become so effective hasn't he
at the net yep throughout the course of
his
[Applause]
career playable since winning that
second set his 300th here at the
Australian Open jovic is looking awfully
good
[Music]
[Music]
3
time what a sight what a sporting
Precinct what an
event and that's what they're playing
for to get their hands on the Norman
Brooks challenge
cup Australia's first warland champion
ion
alongside Raphael
Nadal this man is going to need some
Wizardry this evening no question about
that if he wants to get by jovic
15
[Music]
love this
15
no I do think if there were Harry Potter
characters call us would be
Harry nov would be Dumbledore
what a tennis
Nation 15 what about
C well there's an obvious look alike
isn't there with the hair no kidding
he's got to be
run I don't know if that's doing a
disservice in terms of his magical
powers or not
let to service need to read up on the
series oh it's
brilliant he needs a few of those
alaras some UNR returned serves he needs
some some oxygen in this match a couple
of more comfortable holds thank
[Applause]
[Music]
for to3
[Music]
T is a little
tired just PST 11:30 local
time think we like to step late for
special occasions aren't you always and
this is uh a very special occasion
that's for sure
just when you thought
alcarez was going to hold with an
element of comfort he's pegged back to
juici here
that's
loose looking for the big second into
the body but just lost the
[Applause]
trajectory now five out of his last six
service games including this one that
alar his face break points
G took of
it glorious choreography of how he has
played this game for nearly two decades
by four games to two just goes into
lockdown mode
starts with an incredible Return of the
first serve how often have we seen him
do that against opponents suffocating
them into
submission and you can't see it hasn't
been coming just mentioned that the Run
of games where he's had break points
it's a real blow for alarz though having
LED 405 he must have felt like he was
starting to weather the storm yeah just
when you're
relax maybe just
slight dip in Focus costing him
there love 15 and the other part to that
is when noak's in these movs his
emotional calm is I mean it's so level
when he's in these uh pockets of time
where he's almost
impliable and I think Roger I would
argue that he
practices his mental training more than
most and I think that's why he's able to
get into those stages and probably stay
in them a little longer more than most
please 14 w
v right off on the Baseline for that
second Ser return no surprised to see
jovic go for the fast one first and
second
and please stop when the players are
ready to surve thank you it is a
surprise to see him miss
[Applause]
it 154
[Applause]
304
[Applause]
not out of the woods yet two
saved one remaining
Al without a doubt the F ground strokey
game we've seen in a while from
caros and he's right back in this third
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
set oh what a Twist there almost like a
bit of frustration almost anger the
first couple of points really let some
for hands
go all of a sudden we're back on serve
in this third
set got that's the the point that just
got him out of position the shot I
should say four down the line he wasn't
sure if he was coming in or not jovic
and from then on in the rally he was
just half a step behind could didn't
play catch
[Applause]
up time
[Music]
that was in the change of ANS
nov make some words with Eva
esimu both players now they have been
broken four times each this evening
oh missed
it just to put that into context coming
into the quarterfinals 15 alz was broken
three times
jovic five
[Music]
times man a good anticipation there good
stab volley but definitely wide
come on how's that return love 13 it's
the depth isn't it that forces
alcarez to take some real risk on the
forehand just dragged it white yeah but
did he need to and that's the point
that's this is where he blows a couple
of points I think that hurt him in these
matches didn't need to be hitting the
out right
there g r
and
again
14 very loose game
here and the returning from Novak in the
set has been a stratospheric levels when
he's got his record on the ball first
and second serves he's only missed three
returns
this entire sit thank you
[Music]
game what a
forehead there's a to the
[Applause]
party what a leads by five games to
three the depth is back and it's back in
a big
[Applause]
way sending his fans
into a frzy thank
you serving for two sets to one
lead let second
service love 15
can tell you playing on a hard
court losing the first point chances of
holding serve go down by about 27%
what a magnificent change of
pace you just don't know what's coming
next do you such a loose service game
okay jovic and outstanding final point
to break and then all of a sudden just a
moment of Brilliance
again rare occasion we've seen the
backand drop shot tonight vast majority
of been on the
forehand pure perfection
15 13
well he's
persisted but trying to hug the Baseline
for the second serve
return jovic gets him there with that
fast second serve that he loves 184 km
an hour it's very tough to to move in
and time that thank you
he's just so plugged in right now 4
[Applause]
set point for jovic to take a two sets
to one lead
oh
[Applause]
J
manovic by
three well even by jovic's standards it
is simply
stunning leads by two sets to one two
sets to one lead in the bank
[Music]
jovic is loving
this he's up at a bottle of vintage and
he's orchestrating this crowd after the
controversy of recent days as well
almost pointing as if to say this is for
all of you this master class set are
putting on and I think alcarez started
to cramp at the end of that point yeah
he looked like he's feeling some
discomfort didn't he
yeah he was almost looking across the
net in admiration at what jovic produced
there look at the second serve points
one huge differential there jovic
winning 64% despite a couple of double
faults H has just 29 he is really
struggling to defend his second server
the first set where jovic has hit more
winners than the
Spaniard I mean look at the depth again
both players at the end of their
physical
limits right here but you just keep time
pushing and pushing just go into that
dark space but that's where you need the
mind control and jovic has got it in
spades
[Applause]
what a way to win
s 15 left seven more to go
some of them car on roting to say with
ACC you did get some cramp at the end of
that during that last Point see whether
there's any whether that flares or that
was just a a split moment M big game
here for him too because know that will
be pressing he can see a little bit of a
an opportunity
mentally 15 and that third set with it
was
actually fairly convincing I felt for
jovic he was well on top just one
service game where alarz sort of Came
Out Swinging broke back for 4-3 but
other than that it was just jovic
holding pretty well Relentless pressure
on the alarz serve he he was well on top
[Music]
[Music]
he's everywhere right
now well these are amazing points for us
to watch of course they are
but is this alarz maybe just running out
of ideas we're seeing everything
here and as you say Robbie jovic has got
all the answers
[Applause]
14 that might be only the the fourth or
fifth by my calculation return that he's
missed since the start of the third
set that's how good it's been he still
got one more horns
[Applause]
here first game four set this is quite
extraordinary it's ocz been broken to
the third straight service game that's
the sixth tonight
just have a look here this what happened
at the end of that enormous
rally he sat down and then had to
quickly get up again because I think
there was a bit of cramp looks like in
the right leg the right hip
area maybe the
[Applause]
glute and those glutes are Maximus
aren't they it's pretty significant yeah
[Music]
thank you ladies and
Gentlemen please
love
15 I think this is where we could see
alar is now really starting to unload on
everything yeah the previous game that
the last forand almost just felt
like well maybe not his will have been
broken but certainly significantly
damaged and you're right I think he may
just start to open his shoulders and and
really start to have a swing
here and that can happen when a player
is
30 15 struggling behind in a match like
this and and you're almost sort of just
letting go of the outcome for a while
and just saying I'm going to have a
swing here it feels like it's going
against me anyway so I might as well
throw caution to the wind and and and
see what can
happen two sets to one
breakdown he's got to find something
alarz
[Applause]
140 15
thank you
oh that is out of order that
shot
43 Exquisite what of you
Ser has been so good so good in the last
decade or so it's one of the reasons
that he's been able to go so deep at so
many of these majors and if he's able to
win tonight it'll be the 550th Grand
Slam
semifinal which will be the most amongst
the men in the singles
category it was Roger at 46
Novak now the overwhelming favorite but
got to give a shout out to chrisit if
you think Novak's numbers are
good Chris evit participated in 56
majors in her career she made the semi
finals or better in 52 of
them that's just a joke isn't it all but
four in her career she doesn't make the
semi-finals or better I'm not sure
those numbers will ever be beaten we
often forget some of the numbers she
posted on Clay she
was an absolute Warrior a
[Music]
maven but just let that sink in if jovic
wins here 50 out of 77 Majors he'll have
made the
semi-final it's mind boggling isn't it
of course he's going for hise 25th Grand
Slam
title 15 I can't help but think the
conditions the the nighttime conditions
have suited him in this matchup you know
with still a bit of speed in the court
but the ball not jumping around as much
as it would have in In the Heat of the
day the afternoon I mean he has just
been locked
in certainly
15 the last two and a half
sets it's very difficult for alcarez to
get the ball out of his Hitting Zone
tonight
that's the first one he's got
wrong but he won't mind cuz he leads by
two sets to one and a break in the
fourth
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
cor must feel an enormous amount of
relief in this change of ends
because it's the first time I'm facing a
break point since the eighth game of the
second
set talk about hard work that's still
draining isn't
it
[Music]
[Music]
t for here at the rod labor Arena
it's quarterfinals day at the Australian
Open
2025 and
please what a few matches we have had
today highly entertaining contests all

[Music]
[Applause]
30 of course in the other quarterfinal
tomorrow Ben Shelton will take on

[Applause]
Sono what a 10 days it has been for Sona
please it's disturbing for the players
thank
you Ben Shelton now the last remaining
man in the
drawer American
man thanks Colin
[Music]
of course the Americans started
with most number time with the Aussies
14 of them
[Applause]
started where do this come
from shaky double there from jovic
just the third in the match
another ready drenched in
quality 21 high quality shots
it's ball striking of the very highest
order from both men
and the most impressive part about this
is that the breeze is it it's coming
it's going down towards no side so he's
pressing not only the strength and the
the power of the acr's game but also
working against the breeze
it's not sure if you guys have been on
this court when when it's a little windy
it's tough down there so this is
extremely impressing from impressive
from knack
game to of
eight no back almost laughing towards
this
Camp how about made that everything's
going my way
now but for me that's just the most
brilliant shot I think he deliberately
gives that a bit of air over the
backhand Wing knowing that alarz was
coming forward knowing that that would
make life difficult for him alarz
hesitated left it and not even he could
recover yeah I think you're bang
on if he gives him that ball sort of
between waist and shoulder height I
think he moves across and crunches a
volley
thank you ladies and gentlemen maybe
he's looking at an that's one of your
shots there one of those ones that you
hustle back into play borrowed that one
from
you please
sir
service please
[Music]
it's a PlayStation tennis bing bing just
pinging around both of them taking a l
ladies and gentlemen I please do not
disturb the players like that thank you
[Applause]
left time alcarez has whistled The Joy
strick from jovic I'm taking control now
for a
[Applause]
while no guessing Every Which Way in
this
[Music]
rally beautiful extension through the
forehead for TB
new balls please well Speedy hole just
what alarz needed to stay in touch in
this for by three games to
[Applause]
two oh one of the problems in that third
set was the lack of fre points on
serve just testimony to how many returns
jovic was putting in play only missing
three but also look at the the trend
look at the pattern so many deep into
the backhand Corner we identified that
in the first set where alarz was hitting
100% of first shots after a serve with
his forehand jovic has uh not just been
consistent he's been
accurate a master class in returning
serve really and even the ones that he
has missed he has at least got them over
the net so he's taken the N Out of play
completely
[Music]
there
[Music]
time we' seen plenty of
those almost 3 hours in the
making I'll tell you what the fans here
been treated to some champagne tennis at
times
most of it has been coming from
NOC has been striking early in the
sets just trying to maintain his lead
here he's got some new
balls serving with the wind at his back
it's okay to stand up on the basine on
the second S turn but the problem is the
way Novak's striking the ball at the
moment you get caught out on the next
shot and then you're in defense mode the
hway through the rally not a great
option yeah surprising that
he's almost exclusively stood up as well
there hasn't really been much
variety have to make their
2425 please tied with Margaret
Court 24 majes
but of course all of his in the open
[Applause]
era 30 love
[Applause]
he's actually only
hit maybe seven or eight seconds of
returns from deep in the court here
aloras the vast majority have been up on
the Baseline and well as Roger and
Robbie have alluded to maybe flipping
that script might have
been more effective it's easy with
hindsight but the vast majority deep and
then the change up being moving up onto
the Bas Baseline in certain
[Music]
moments C 15 M the last two or three
times up this end has lost his first
serve and with that little bit of Breeze
his Bol TOS gets a little too far in
front of him so loses a little bit of
margin hasn't been able to find his
range here on the first serve
that first serve was definitely too far
in front as as Roger said dragged it
down into the net just engaging with
Andy Murray here we saw Murray tell him
to bring the toss back against lka in
the previous round didn't
we from this end of the Court as well so
just a recurring
theme much better toss there able to go
up and attack the Ser get the the neck
clear friend
[Applause]
he actually saw that
coming yeah he was on his bike before
alz hit the drop
shot but a rear recurrence when he
couldn't find the the right shot in the
big
moment just watch how quickly jovic
start spinning forward here just before
alar hits his drop
shot must have too much time to think
about this
wow
wow what time to produce a second
surve that quality astonishing Advantage
jovic this lots of guys who had quick
first serves but it's the
accuracy you've highlighted on many
occasions
[Applause]
R just
Precision I think he may be there a b CR
P just please interesting let's just
keep an eye on he was walking gingerly
up to that to receive the ball and up to
that line Robbie okay
an absolute
screamer and alar once this Rod labor
Arena crowd back on his side and this is
how to win the over
devastating forehand there thank
you let for
service just small things like that let
now allows jovic just to get his breath
back after that last
rally little bit of extra recovery
time talk about small nuances making
such a big difference
Advantage we saw in the Cuna match as
well right
getting a second reprieve when the
little net hook
snapped allowed him more time to recover
that took about 15 minutes to finally
fix no
way not often you see dead leg cords
like that well could that be a a point
and a Big Slice of luck for alarz that
we'll look back
upon if that falls back on the Spaniard
side it's 42 jovic and he's well on his
way thank you quiet
please and again he's had some Stone
words with his camp and obviously one
callus I think it's all about the return
of serve
he's
persisting he's up on the Baseline but
it's not working zovic
[Applause]
in many ways tonight the biggest
difference between the two has been
serve and return
pee
telling you I can't believe he's not
making the adjustment guys cannot
believe it I
mean through the first didn't we yeah
agre Rob I'm actually staggered that he
hasn't just felt that you know you you'd
have to be able to feel that you're not
making in RS from that position of the
court and also as a coach sometimes when
you're involved in the match you don't
feel up the coach from the outside
looking in yeah yeah exactly mind caros
I mean we obviously respect
his talent and his eye but maybe he's
just you know also stubborn you I'm
thinking I'm just going to crash through
okay yeah possibly something they've
worked on in the offseason and and
ladies and gentlemen they're sticking
with it quiet when the players are
ready 15 love
[Music]
15
[Applause]
[Music]
get that left hand involved he's saying
third 15
that's what creates the spin on the back
end 14 15
please
[Music]
40
[Music]
P got a bit of skills I think it's in
the Spaniards DNA that
one another a drop shot is without a
doubt in alarz his DNA but he's faltered
here and he can ill afford to be
broken tell you what right
now jovic can see that Finishing Line in
the distance
the vice like grip Titans from jovic
he's just squeezing arz here he
knows the young Spaniard is on the
edge a Monumental point please
f
[Music]
a
[Music]
oh that is beyond
special both players bleeding themselves
try to win
what a
moment a better point you could not wish
to
see yes
[Applause]
yes throwing Haymaker after Haymaker at
each other and somehow Al is able to
[Applause]
[Music]
survive it's a sort of point that just
has the
potential to change things here yeah no
kidding and the reaction from
alcarez ignited the crowd
[Music]
[Applause]
alarz is sticking
around what a
contest they've both become human
highlight's real
43 for
six and look at these
scenes if alarz loses that point the
match is over you know 99 times out of
100 and yet here he is somehow he's won
it he's held serve and he's pumping his
fist feeling like he's right back in
this thing and you just wonder what has
that taken out of jovic physically and
mentally he'll use this uh change of
ends to just get his heart rate back
down calm his emotions he's still just
two holds a serve away from the
[Music]
semifinals this
is well there is something special about
this
[Music]
[Applause]
and he's coming from
behind it's going to require a zenat
like finish because I can tell you since
winning the first hit 64
alz has never been ahead hasn't been
ahead in the second the Third or the
fourth sets at any point thank you
ladies and gentlemen the still down a
break thank you as well as he played in
his last service game please
[Music]
it hasn't the move Chang down here no
looking for a Ser volley point off the
first ball but how about Carlos still
behind but revving himself up as if he's
about to win this match it's
extraordinary his attitude first class
please
is
love 1 it's the spaniard's turn to enjoy
a little bit of wind in their
sails he's finding something from deep
within here
alarz and he's got some real belief at
this stage
now tell you jovic needs a first serve
urgently Colin
how about
that 15
1 well we don't see it with huge
regularity but for me that back hand
down the
line is one of the shots no jovic will
always be remembered for no kidding
please please ladies and gentlemen
that's enough remember like yesterday
can
2007 being the top three players in the
world to win the title there
back-to-back
matches it's changing of directions it
was a joke
a
KZ is trying to beat down jovic's
door 15
14 and once again he makes him pay from
missing a first
Surf and is it just starting to look
like there's 15 years and 349 days
between them Alura certainly uh the more
energized at this stage
[Applause]
what an initial back end Novak played
off the first ball that was he was
wanting to take full control there's the
forehand from Carlos but that was
outstanding as good as ball as you can
hit to keep control of the rally and
they make it look so normal don't there
Ro do it so
often take it for
granted still another break point though
for the
spard let foress service
BL for service
such Clarity of thought under
pressure yes
[Applause]
and the safety of his volley here
Robbie how good his volle's improved
over his
journey doesn't get enough credit for
his hands it's just the fourth time he
saw volley tonight first time in this
set context matters doesn't
it what a time to do
it oopsy
[Applause]
that's no coincidence suddenly starts
making first
serves the
[Applause]
point just a strength there on the the
left toe
he's
tough G to of
eight five meaningful first serves in
that game Ed joov ever closer to the
Finishing
[Applause]
Line seats please thank you ladies and
gentlemen this is what they came to see
their
man please
ladies and Gentlemen
please 15 love
[Applause]
[Applause]
well that's how you hit a return if
you're going to stand up on the Baseline
for a second
serve crunched into the
corner
[Music]
please 30 15
14
15 these kind of service games have been
few and far between for
alcarez since the start of the second
set most most of the holds have been
hard to come
[Applause]
by and after the break
jovic will have a chance to serve for a
place in his 50th semifinal at a major
[Music]
what do you make of what you've seen
from alcarez today
Colin well we we've spoken a lot this
tournament about the work he's done in
the the preseason particularly around
the
serve um first Ser percentage has been
good 74% for the match I still think
there's a ways to go for him in terms of
the accuracy of that delivery and indeed
improving his second serve I think his
second serve return which he's clearly
made a commitment to taking up on the
Baseline on hardc court hasn't worked
for him tonight back to the drawing
board there and ultimately he's been
outplay to this point by
[Applause]
jovic n jovic is looking for
major number
[Applause]
25 thank you ladies and G be a very
important step on the path to achieving
that
15 love
just has to go into play at the very
least what a
gift just what you want if you're Novak
jovic
and just to let you know about the
tension that obiously he's been here a
lot times but when he went to sit down
he asked Andy in the group what about my
serve what should I do with my arm and
and they're all sort of pointing to
keeping your arm up and so you can see
the tension around him what he feeling
about his serve right now
subtle genius there from
jovic the ball down low on his forehand
the Easy Shot or the easier shot the
obvious shot is to whip this Cross Court
over the lower part of the net but not
jovic he's back in behind
alarz and he's two points away here
f
that's a proper back hand
beautiful combination of
[Applause]
shots thank
you please
[Music]
[Applause]
40
13 3 hours and 36 minutes of high octane
tenis
[Applause]
please thank
you
please Novak at match point
[Music]
it's a 50th Grand slam semifinal for
no he was compelling he was
commanding and ultimately he was just a
little too cunning for his younger
opponents he takes down ararez and four
46 64 63
64 and a rod Leever Master CLA
look at these scenes as he goes over to
embrace Andy muray did you ever think we
would see that in this SP but here is
Novak jovic
37 years of age he'll be 38 in a few
months and he has still got it make no
mistake about that he has reminded us
and the whole tennis world including
Carlos sarz and the rest of this draw
that he has still got it and he has some
serious title credentials still at the
Australian Open in his pursuit of a 25th
Grand Slam
title he's just caught from a different
flot isn't
he just a mental giant today and we
thought he was struggling
physically yeah and Ro called it didn't
he R called it we've seen him struggle
but he has this ability just to put that
the back of his
mind and just sharpen the focus and I
think it helped him I think it it it it
was wake up call if that's the right way
to put it to say I have to go for my
shots I have to play aggressive tennis
and from that moment the start of the
second he dominated the
match well he's always so entertaining
to watch that he'll be disappointed that
he is leaving the first major of the
year at the Cor the final stage Colin
yeah in his pursuit of the career Grand
Slam goes on he put a lot of work in in
the pre-season to try and be as ready as
he could be to evolve and develop his
game to try and get his hands on this uh
title for the first time not to be tough
draw jovic in the quarters wasn't it and
he's going to go away and dissect it
with his team I'm sure figure out where
it went wrong ultimately though
jovic too good on the night
[Music]
oh Tara and Stefon loving every minute
of it and at the age now when they can
appreciate what their dad is
[Music]
achieving just a word for alarz as well
what a special player but a special
human being we have in our sport not
once did he complain tonight he embraced
the CH challenge he enjoyed the
challenge he gave it everything he had
and he looked jovic in the eyes he Shan
just said well played too
good well let's sh from Novak
[Applause]
now Novak we've seen you play so many
amazing matches in your long and
illustrious career and this one for me
is going to be one that I'll long
remember how in the world did you win
this match with with all the
circumstances tonight against
Carlos uh
well um with my two legs and two arms I
guess but one and a half leg but uh you
know first I I want to say uh my utmost
uh respect and admiration for Carlos and
everything he stands for and what he has
achieved so far in his young
career um
what a terrific guy he is and even
better competitor uh youngest ever
number one in the world um the history
of our Sports so four grand slams and
I'm sure that we're going to see a lot
of him maybe not as much as uh I would
like but uh he's going to he's going to
be there for sure uh longer than me um
and you know I just wish that this this
uh match today was the finals honestly I
I uh
I don't know if Sasha ver is still awake
1:00 a.m. he's watching this uh I'm sure
he his team is
um yeah just one one of the one of the
the most epic matches I've played on
this court on any court on any Court
really so thank you all for staying at
1:00 a.m. to watch us and support the
players so the match got underway in a
rather normal circumstance you guys were
were playing your normal Styles and then
you got injured and you had to take a
medical time out we saw you come back
out with strapping what were you dealing
with what was the injury
issue well you know since I'm still in
the tournament I don't want to reveal
too much obviously but uh yeah the the
the the medication started to kick in
and they helped no no doubt I had to
take another dose um I mean this sounds
awful I me me take another dose but but
I had to you know
um I didn't know to be honest you know
if if I lost that second set I don't
know if I would continue playing but you
know I felt better and better managed to
to play a great couple of games to to
end up the second set and then you know
I saw that that Carlos uh you know was
hesitant a little bit from back of the
court and you know I took my chances and
started to feel better started to move
better so it didn't it didn't bother me
it didn't create any inance U towards
the end of the match only in that second
set and obviously when when the
medications uh uh start to release I'll
see what the the reality is you know
tomorrow morning um but yeah you know
right now I I will just try to be in a
moment and and enjoy this Victory as you
should some some of this match in the
changes that you made with your game how
much more aggressive you got reminded us
of what you did here two years ago when
you suffered a leg injury in the middle
of the tournament and then you got very
aggressive with your forehand and you
went on to win the tournament did that
experience help you make those decisions
tonight or was this completely different
sorry I I I heard your question but I'm
just I'm I'm surprised that my kids are
still here I mean
it's I mean I love you thank you for
supporting me but it's 1:00 a.m. when
are you going to sleep tonight
they don't want me to speak about them
yeah okay uh back to
tennis uh yeah back in
2023 I think yeah I I
actually had a similar injury and uh
carried it basically from the beginning
of the tournament and just had to had to
go for for my shots more uh honestly
sometimes it helps I mean it definitely
helped in the second and third
Set uh you know there's we are so
nervous on the court you know there's a
lot lot happening you're going through
emotional turmoil up and down you know
uh any point can really shift the
momentum to the other side particularly
when you play on such a high level
against the champion like Carlos so he
he brings the intensity incredible
energy and and and competitive Spirit to
the court so you know you got to come
out and and and and be at your best so I
knew that uh it was unfortun for what
happened towards the end of the set for
me but in that perspective uh the way
you explain it I think comparing to the
2023 performances I had I think he does
help mentally because you know you just
all of a sudden start to play a bit more
aggressive you go through your shots
more so I guess that's going to be uh
necessary for me I guess in a couple of
days time when I face as veryan semis
and that's one advantage if there is in
playing today it's Tuesday the
semi-finals isn't until Friday for you
so you do get that extra day off so
that's beneficial but you'll need it
against Sasha he's a great player too
you guys have played a lot of times what
will be the keys in that match for you
as you look forward to the semi-finals
besides waking up painfree tomorrow
hopefully a little correction Jim today
is Wednesday already
true
um God knows when we're going to go to
sleep um I guess the key is recovery for
me now you know to be honest uh that's
that's all I'm thinking about uh the
extra day with no match comes at the at
the perfect time for me um let's see if
it's going to be good enough um on
Friday hopefully I can come out and and
feel my best because you know Sasha is
playing some of the best anyes he has
played and um yeah we have an agreement
as long as I play he's going to let me
win Grand Slam matches well it's all
settled then congratulations on the run
to the finals now just no back
incredible once again
e
