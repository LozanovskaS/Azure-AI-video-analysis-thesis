so an immediate chance to take a look at
the Dio serve
here 15 l
six for eight is di that's two me three
[Applause]
I feel like for Dio to have success in
this match he's really going to have to
keep that first serve percentage pretty
high and try and keep the points a
little bit shorter I feel the longer
that these rallies go in extended more
Advantage for feast
left it face he was there for it too Fe
that's interesting I mean look as a
player you get a sense if that ball is
going to be looking like it's going long
but to him just to stop playing when
he's there in position to hit a for end
got to wait to hear the call there
that's a nice positive start for Dio no
doubt a few nerves stepping into this
match first time ever playing a second
round at a grand slam hopefully that
will just settle him
down said that he's really looked up to
the likes
of have to
to yeah that that's something that get
used to seeing from I I feel like as
soon as he recognizes a short ball he
doesn't wait uses his speed not only on
defense you see it there uses it on
offense takes a lot of time away from
his opponent and follows that in at the
net and makes it look easy
[Applause]
a decent start to the year did feast
made the quarterfinals in Hong Kong and
then the semi-finals in Oakland his
first two events of the year but then
went really quiet for quite some time
didn't win too many matches to be honest
with you from kind of the Australian
Open all the way through until kind of
the Grass Court season did win a
Challenger went on the clay but at tour
level he would have been pretty
disappointed I think with the results
that he put together and then he went
quarterfinals in h made the second week
at Wimbledon where he lost to Dem and or
but he'd already beaten the likes of
Hubert herat there and then of course
winning that title in Hamburg his second
ATP Tour level
title beat runer in the quarterfinals
there Sebastian Bay in the semis
[Applause]
14
15 he had a potential banana skin
opponent in the first round didn't he
against LNA Tien who has just been
winning so many matches over the last
few
months the young 18y olds
oh what a strike so
good I spoke to Marty Loro a little bit
yesterday and he said that Dio is
someone that plays much more freely when
he's playing higher ranked players so
when he's playing someone like Fe today
he feels like he could swing a little
bit more free and not feel that sort of
pressure and obviously getting that
first Grand Slam win under his belt just
GNA free him up even more when you win a
lot of matches like that it just Builds
on the confidence
[Applause]
deuce and even early on here Adam you
could see that f is pretty far back
behind the Baseline sometimes once these
rallies get going and Dio is going to do
the opposite he's going to want to step
in and try and rip and take time away
from feast
but he's done really well toale himself
out of trouble there Feast cuz that was
some return a great return I I think
actually Dio should have probably let
that one bounce I know he was trying to
take more time away but again that was
the more difficult of the two if he
would have let that bounce he would have
had a pretty routine forehand there
good hold in the end but always nice
from a a return his point of view just
to lay down a bit of a marker early on
and just say yeah you're going to have
to work pretty hard to hold serve
today yeah look that's that's something
that Dio is going to have to do all day
long he's going to really try and be
aggressive on the return of serves and
first and foremost his focus is serve
plus one that that's where he needs to
take advantage here and really dictate
points from the getco early on
here surf plus zeros are always good too
yeah even better when you have a serve
like Dio has you're going to get those
fre points and and look uh for someone
of his his height and his power if if
you could get one or two free points a
game that that's you're on track
be 15 off
oh
13
[Applause]
15 pretty big second serve there from
Dio it's got a lot of movement on it so
started up the T and actually ended up
right into the body of Fe that's smart
serving there thought maybe he followed
in we saw how far back fees was on the
return to serve there
[Applause]
so little half chance here for
Fe very good Junior was the young
Frenchman won the Orange Bowl in
2020 prestigious tournament and also
made the boys singles final at
Junior Roland garos where he actually
lost to his fellow Countryman there Luca
van
a 14
some second serve 109 milph right into
the body of the
Frenchman Dio does well to come through
the game and stay ahead to lead
21 Stadium 17 there was basically not a
free seat to be had this morning for our
first match this place will just
continue to fill up over the next 10
minutes or
so 15 yeah still early on here both
players still feeling out each other
getting each other's patterns especially
on the serve
no lock
[Applause]
why the net is making an odd noise isn't
it well two reasons one there's a
microphone on the net so it's a little
more sensitive it's making like a b yeah
it's so tight the Nets are strung here
at the US Open you you'll notice that
when it Clips the top of the net CT it's
going to go pretty high compared to
other tournaments it's noticeably
different here
that great hands and a great point from
Al Fe really winding up on that forehand
good defense here from Dell as well
keeping this one a little bit low making
Fe come up with that drop shot had a
good look at the pass there thought
maybe he was going to go down line but
good read there from Fe and good hands
and reaction well
done remember you can download the US
Open app to follow your Faceook favorite
players you can watch match highlights
new this year you can get live 3D views
of all singles matches as well so if
you've not got it it's available on the
Apple App Store and the Google Play
Store as
well oh heard it again there cuz that
hit the top of the top of the
it's not been making that noise the rest
of the week is that just me no yes maybe
but no I'm I'm hearing it as well Adam I
promise they put a fresh microphone on
there Beast is going to want that
overhead back cuz that lob was not quite
deep enough there from Dio
again not holding back with that second
serve Dio another one well over 100
miles an
hour that's pretty routine for him his
second serve doesn't usually drop below
100 miles hour and that's an easy surf
for him as well right like if a lot of
other players to hit a second surf over
100 they're going to put some effort
into it Dio has such a live arm and the
motion is pretty smooth and easy going
just yeah not not a lot can go wrong
with that service motion it's very clean
and technically sound for sure 1 15
one of the other things Adam that Marty
Loro said about Dio is that he plays
some of his best tennis when he gets on
four five match win streaks and he's had
multiple win streaks this year of four
five wins and obviously here getting
through qualifying and winning his first
match in the main draw just going to
build on that and that's when he says
he's most
dangerous
14 you actually came into the US Open
off the back of making the semi-finals
of the kryy Challenger lost to MAA
beluchi in that semi-final won the
Chicago Challenger end of July how'd he
doing his home college town of Lexington
quarters right quarters in Lexington
yeah lost to xia fona the young
Brazilian
there yep former standout at University
of Kentucky shout out to the wild cats
watching so good holds from 30 all this
time for Gabriel
Dio and the young Canadian stays ahead
here
[Applause]
3-2 he had won too many matches coming
into the US Open on a North American
hard cours cuz he was someone else who
uh went and played the Olympic Games
unfortunately for him lost in the first
round there to mato arnaldi
qu
point now when Dio has a little bit of
time on that forehand to set up he can
really generate a lot of power and pull
F off the court like that with
ease he's had a couple M hits on the for
when you rush it to that side but when
he has time I think because of the take
back and it's a little bit big and loopy
but when he times it
well just crazy how well these guys move
as well 6 for eight
15 he's dealing with the feast fire
power pretty well at the moment Dio he
cranked one up on that forehand there
Feast but it came back pretty easily
1 15
both of these guys were great athletes
when they were growing up they both not
only played tennis but played a lot of
other sports I think quite obviously
with the height of Gabriel Doo a lot of
people were almost trying to push him
down the basketball
route oh
Wow's going to want that one back
yellow's going to shake that one off but
not sure if he thought that was going to
go over that was a little bit of a
hesitation but great point there from
both
players thought it was over right here
did a great job of making Feast play
that extra ball that one definitely
changed his mind last second can see the
slight hesitation
yeah I love that return there from Dio
down the middle of the Court take away
the angle from Feast to start off the
rally and then you can start getting
into the Cross Court rally if you get
one for Dio like like I I really feel he
needs to go middle a lot more on the
return of
serve cuz if he doesn't connect with it
perfectly and you give Fe and angle he's
going to make you move and he'll make
you
pay dud
[Applause]
he started playing tennis when he was
just 5 years of age but was very good
athlete track and Fields good football
player he said he always knew that
tennis was the sport he was best
at come
on that's a great spot there on that
Ser no chance for Dello on that
[Applause]
[Applause]
can still be quite in and out in his
matches Feast you're never quite sure
what's going to come next yeah I've seen
that on multiple
occasions just like that consistency
isn't quite there
yet it's big though 131 I didn't know
that he had 131 in the pocket there
that's that's some serious heat there
from Fe
[Music]
[Music]
that's a shame set the point up
beautifully with that back hand up the
line
Feast you got to take notice of that
because he was lucky to get out of that
point alive again if you're Dio you say
okay I had the right game plan just
didn't execute there at the end but
again it was the down the-middle shot
that really set that up and then he
moves it around on the back end pulled
that down the line saw the open rack Bas
and snuck in he had the volley he wanted
there
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
has Dio been someone who has kind of
been highly thought of for quite a while
Jesse or is he just kind of snuck up a
little bit over the last few years no
he's definitely been on the radar
especially at tennis Canada over the
last couple
years and obviously he went to college
at University of Kentucky there's a
Canadian connection there I mean
obviously Bruno Augustin Elli Jr who
went there first who was my age and um
made Bruno rest in peace he was an
incredible talent and and play Davis Cup
actually won a huge tie for Canada back
in the day drael went there as well now
Jaden weeks is
there that's good hands there from D you
see that a lot with these universities
in the United States now that once one
player goes there from one country and
they see success it kind of opens a
little bit of a pipeline and you see
that at TCU with with the Brits yep
ky's got Canada locked
down just comes up short after a massive
first serve his biggest of the day so
far Dio up at 128 mph toing at
34 a good start players opening half an
hour no break points as of
yet Dio certainly settled into this
second round match very quickly
love Dio came so close to picking up his
first ever Grand Slam win earlier this
year when he qualified at Roland garos
and ran Kan is shakori all the way was
two sets to love down in that first
round match came back to two sets all
and eventually fell at 75 in the
fifth 15
15 thir another one there for Fe
[Applause]
feel like on the Dio return he actually
may return more solid off the backhand
side he missed more Returns on the
forand but definitely can possess a lot
more power on that side see if he sticks
with the forand serve
again he goes to the back in good change
up
there good Pace behind that one as well
thir
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
you saw that chip return right just lets
Dio get into the point it's a bit of a
pressure point there 30 all Fe is
serving at 34 to try and stay in this
first set really smart play there from
the Canadian
so first break point of this opening set
belongs to Gabriel di G him the chance
to try and serve this set
[Applause]
out well done he missed one of those
earlier on
and you see Dio going back to the chip
that one just left it sitting too short
in the court and feast recognizing this
one good approach shot Dio couldn't
really do much with that but make him
play an extra Ball but again really good
play there from Fe
it's really big
134 that's his biggest of the match so
far got a little extra adrenaline in the
in the
moment he's big but he's not super big
Fe 6'1
such a good return right on the Baseline
deep down the middle as Jesse was saying
but and just can't quite execute on the
forehand and feast Escape saves the
break point and levels things
up thir
[Applause]
feel as though French tennis kind of in
a bit of a transition phase over the
last few years with a lot of the guys
that have represented and flown the flag
of French tennis for so many years the
like gas and Mon and S and J
Simon all either retiring or certainly
heading towards the back end of their
careers but pretty exciting time at the
moment for French tennis not only with
arter Fe
[Music]
but walk solid again from Theos giving
the a little apology for that shank
forand that dropped in but
15 l
France have obviously also got the other
arur at the moment arur
cazo and they have the man who beat
arter at Junior Roland gas in that final
Luca vanash as well
that's big serve there from Tio I tell
you the first serve percentage is low
it's only 50% but when it goes in he's
winning 83% just goes a show in that
first serve is landing and again second
serve points one very high for d as well
he's at 75% right now so he is doing a
really good job of taking care of his
service
games yeah stress free hold to love
and Dio moves to within a game of taking
the opening
set we haven't quite seen the very best
of the Frenchman as yet just five
winners to go alongside his 12 unforced
errors
that's big too short with the
return his second fullhand winner
[Music]
that's what I mean I told you you hit
the top of the net that ball goes way up
in the air they're just strung so tight
here at the US Open across the
board but you were talking about the
stats there on Feast Adam with the 12 on
four stairs and six winners and he's
still very much on serve in this match
withs like that you would think that
maybe he' be down a break
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
14
15 interesting you said earlier Jesse
that Dio's coach mentioned that he
almost plays better against better
players just looking at his record
against top 50 players in his career
he's only played Seven top 50 players
this will be his eighth but he's
actually won three of those seven match
against top 50 Marty Londo doesn't
lie beat Dan Evans
twice once in Canada once in Canada yeah
that was last year in straight sets also
beat him on the grass in in seron last
year and beat Loreno MTI at the Davis
Cup last year as well
there's something look but it's
something to be said when you're playing
guys that are ranked higher than you all
the pressure is off you have the green
light and when you have such an
aggressive game style like Dio has it
just takes the pressure off like today
obviously he's playing the 24 seed he's
not the one that's supposed to win this
match so he can swing freely and you
know really put fear into his opponent
come on come
on just trying to get himself going as
well B sh have come on there at the back
of the Court five games all five games
all D up on his
feet yeah Dad was with him throughout
the whole week of of Hamburg and then he
said uh got to kind of
semifinals day just before we played
Sebastian B and he had his little
brother on the phone he had his mom on
the phone we need to come we need to get
tickets to come to Hamburg so his
brother and his mom flew in as well so
that was cool that they were there for
the semi-final and the
final he said his sister was on vacation
and she there was no way she was coming
back she wasn't she wasn't giving up
that holiday
I think she'll have an opportunity to go
to more finals
yeah and that's a bad error if you're
Arthur Fe fan because you're 10 ft
behind the Baseline there you got to be
able to put that in play somehow can't
miss that one in the net give it some
clearance over the net let yourself get
back into the point
okay we'll try it again that one had
some heighten clearance now the next one
hit with a little bit more spin then
it'll land
in third time's a
charm about that's a
108 with an unbelievable angle and and
that's something that the Yello can can
do regularly from his serve right
because it's coming from a different
trajectory being 6'8 he's able to put
that kind of angle on it and the ball
bounces high too so really difficult to
return
yeah he really has not found a way of
having an influence on the Gabriel Dio
serve whatsoever just two points lost
behind his first serve just three points
behind his second and he guarantees
himself at worst a tie break here
[Applause]
well he's going to say sorry but that's
the old sorry I'm not sorry
because he will take that every day Dio
good approach shot there from Feast but
again nothing you can really do
especially with the way that came off
the tight neck Court there right it's
almost impossible as you're moving
forward
too okay yeah here we go I tell you that
was one of the first clean returns Di's
hit on the forehand side that's really
gone deep into the court with high net
clearance as
[Applause]
well yeah look at the difference there
returns in play against the first serve
fees just but five of Dio's first serves
back caught Dio's but
15 can Feast work a lot
[Music]
harder oh that that's a great turnout
for him that was not easy he had to try
and find it but he's kind of making a
joke to coach martyo there on the volley
thought he could have finished it with
that but again good athleticism here he
had to find it on the other side had to
turn quickly and hits a heavy ball
didn't go for too much really smart
stuff there from Dio so out of nowhere
three set points here for the Canadian
L
service di is going to get really
aggressive on this second serve here
[Applause]
15 he's already got a pretty big fan
base already his arur Fe chance of arur
go around Stadium 17
first set belongs to the qualifier
Gabriel Dio fairly put a foot wrong in
all honesty coach up on his
feet work to do for the 24 SE right
now got to try and harness that in the
right way
[Applause]
a great opening set from this
man 15 you know what I loved about the
end of that set there Adam is dio wasn't
really showing too much emotion through
that first set and then when he got the
first set he let out a little bit of
emotion gave the big fist bump and now
he's back to work again didn't get too
too high on a motion not too low
throughout the set
either good change up
there he's on a charge here 10 of the
last 11 points
I love that serving volley play up 30
love take a chance there he looks over
gives a little nod to coach lond said
hey see that I served him volley and
that's something that he wasn't
comfortable doing you know 12 months ago
was coming forward into the net and
that's a huge Improvement on the Doo
Camp side
yeah just a start he was after in set
two Qui fire hold to
love first game second set
[Applause]
that's good depth there from
Feast he's able to really redirect the
power from yellow well especially when
he's on the move like that it's not easy
to do
that F and off
15
[Applause]
hey what Jesse I've been impressed with
just how solid he is from the back of
the Court he's not just a big server is
he he can certainly hold his own what
what I love about watching Dio from the
Baseline is he doesn't feel like he has
to hit 100% all out all the time he
doesn't Redline the engine he stays he
can hit it at 75% cuz his 75% is just as
big as a lot of the players 90% right
it's it's under
control good Sur from AR th Fe there
feel like Fe hasn't used the body serve
enough yet against the yows stands at
6'8 he's he's given him too many
opportunities to use his length as an
advantage on the
return Sol it from face
again far from easy
30 Gran and dad on their
feet second set had huge success here as
a player Sebastian gr on the only Grand
Slam that he didn't actually make it all
the way through to the semi-finals best
of a third round here three times made
the semis of all the other
three man he was fun to watch yeah I
actually had a lot of chances to
practice with him when I was young oh
nice he was so good great guy as well on
and off the court
yeah got up to four in the
[Music]
worlds amazing tenant
yeah and I said at the beginning of the
match the longer the rallies win
Advantage Feast but I feel like the
longer these rallies are going di is
really getting dialed in especially when
he gets pulled out to the forehand he
can really whip that forand around and
he's showed that on the forehand side
when he gets pushed out wide he goes
Cross or line it's not just one way so
it really keeps Feast off balance
I like that play there from p goes right
at di on that first passing shot didn't
try and hit too good of a shot right
here drills one right at him has to get
out of the way and then passes him on
the next
[Applause]
one he knows that's not the strength of
the Doo game is a volley so he makes him
hit a tough one first and then passes
him on the next one
just clipping the net on the way through
little apology but this is probably the
best look that Fe has had so far today
on the Dio serve
let go of
you for of
you ch
[Applause]
but he went big again with that second
serve only a second double F of the
match but it could be a crucial one
because it gives Alto his first looks at
break points here
[Applause]
oh
such a great
play face look at the
reaction excellent response after
dropping the opening set
[Applause]
know Adam after he's getting that first
break of the match for him you feel like
he would almost loosen up a little bit
and play a little bit more freely cuz
Dio hadn't let him into any service
games throughout this match so far
he just paid the price didn't he hasn't
made many first serves sto in this set
only three yeah he's made him
pay 15 home
that's 3 mph second serve double
fault Dio double fault in the last game
and was punished for
[Applause]
it double the number of Errors to
winners for fee so far today
[Music]
this a hor G
yeah opposite he's actually tightened up
and Dio doing a good job just putting
balls in play right now not going for
too much he can sense that Beast is a
little bit off this game after breaking
it's a huge opportunity for Doo
yeah well apart from that final point it
was a game that was really gifted to
Gabriel
Dio but what a response breaks back
immediately two games old yeah that's
going to frustrate a lot works so hard
to get that break just to almost gift it
right back to Dio
and not easy to be in the Dio service
games right if you're feast and that you
got to let that go now it's really not
easy to do easier said than done but has
to start fresh
again well you can stay connected to the
US Open on Facebook X Instagram Tik Tok
YouTube and WhatsApp you can join the
conversation with us uh just uh use the
hash usop let us know your thoughts on
what's already unfolded the first four
days what's going to potentially come
over the next N9 or 10 days that we have
left of this tournament
[Applause]
L 15
L for service
it's a big forand
fromo giving up the first point
there 15 all
he's so
quick that was not an easy shot to hit
for feast and thought G was going to get
lucky with that LE for but somehow
sneaks it by him good hands there so
difficult to do that when you're running
forward that fast as
well inside out backand well done there
from feast
that's brilliant de right up the
Baseline impressive from Fe as well not
not only from a tennis standpoint from a
a mental strength standpoint after being
up a break and giving it back and now
giving yourself a couple more
opportunities
here not easy to regroup he's done a
great job this game
yeah all credit to AR just right back on
it and for the second
[Applause]
lck of
[Applause]
can you believe
this L 30 again
I would have said that there's no way in
this PCH throughout the whole time that
there' be four breaks in a row yeah I
wouldn't expect that at all from both
players obviously but especially with a
serve like
Dio
wow credit to Dio again in this game now
for staying strong just being
solid this is unbelievable Adam
so three break points to break back
again face is such a good return from
Dio I actually like that drop shot play
from
Dio if you're going to go short with
that volley though crosscourt you better
make this good he just didn't quite make
this good enough right here this volley
right there if you're going to go
crosscourt you got to do a little bit
more with it cuz if you don't hit a
winner you got no chance to stay in that
point and Beast Mak some pay
[Applause]
Inc four breaks in a
row twice Al has been in control of this
second set twice he has just surrendered
that lead instantaneously three games
all he cut Marty on his feet again feel
like both coaches been up on their feet
a couple times just realizing the moment
in this match and when I talk to Marty
Londo after his second round qualifying
when he goes I tell you one thing Jesse
goes Gabe he is a tough kid that was one
thing he said cuz obviously he was
working through a little bit of that
quad issue and he's a tough kid he's
going to get through this and when he
does he'll have a couple days off and
look now he wins his first round in the
main draw and in a battle here with 24
seed you surely cannot have five breaks
in a
row 15 yeah that little break between uh
between qualifying and the main draw
probably gave
a nice little rest is it just to try and
recover whatever injury was there
obviously we qualifying finishing on the
Thursday last week and theno didn't play
his first round main draw match until
the
Tuesday a lot of that KT tape on there
what it's called yeah
Kio tap thank you yeah but KT Tape yeah
boy wasn't it no one wants to hold serve
right now Adam this is
incredible Le didn't have a look at a
single break point in the whole of the
first
set just do with a few more of those
just eight of 18 first serves in this
second set yeah this in this moment in
the match it's so important for G to put
some first serves in play he can be
aggressive but maybe take a little bit
off and hit your
spots but give yourself some
margin like that and 117 is taking a
little bit off for him it's got up to
132
[Music]
today still not quite as quick as Feast
134 is his quickest
finally have a hold of serve after four
consecutive breaks big Roar of Al from
Gabriel Dio
shifting long
[Applause]
[Applause]
his head must be spinning here Fe
wondering how on Earth am I 3 four down
here
[Applause]
1 15 and that's the return that D's had
a lot of success on again said it a
couple of times already that middle
[Applause]
one that one just got a little bit away
from him but the intentions were all
really good there from Dio
we just saw that stat of the unforce
airs on the backend side alone and feast
was already at at eight on the backhand
alone that's nine now Dio only had five
if you would have said backend to
backend rally it probably would have
given that advantage to Feast to start
this match
agreed anxious looking yeah Sebastian
groan and dad there as well
and Dio may look at the court on that
one in the bounce but that was a
tentative forehand
there definitely was ahead in that
rally good defensive slice there from Fe
[Music]
so Feast finally holds serve as
well four GES off below his best though
at the moment if he could just sneak
through this second set expect his level
to to improve as this match goes
[Applause]
on this call has been basically
full for the last what six seven hours
or so
[Music]
[Applause]
feel like there's been so many neck
cords in this yeah I I I agree
well it's always a risk as Jesse
mentioned so often his second serve is
over 100 miles hour so that is going to
bring a little bit of danger with it his
third double fault
can ala go a break in front for a third
time it's just a bad error not trying to
do anything really there with that for
hands just releases the pressure a
little bit
to off
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
that's a huge Point de for Dio
didn't want to get into that back end to
backend rally anymore cuz he has been
making so many errors on that side and
tries to change direction down the line
gave it no clearance and huge
opportunity for Doo to get out of this
game
yeah if you're if your fees right now
you want to get into that 4 and forign
rally and try and Rush the Dio for and
that's the side that Dio is a little bit
more more tentative on right now and
doesn't want to see the ball coming fast
to that side right now if he has time
he's doing just fine it's the fast one
there it's just feel like he's a little
bit
indecisive yellow
nice to have that serve to fall back on
right when you need it tough moment
having to stay in set number two here
after Fe 4 five
he's done a really good job today when
he's come forward
Fe 15 10 visits to the net he's won
eight of those 10
points yeah Feast does a great job of
recognizing the opportunity to come
forward he he comes forward on all the
right
shots that's why not knocking down his
volleys but he comes forward and he
really takes charge and and and has the
right balls to put away he's not coming
forward
on the wrong shots where he may give Dio
a really good look at a passing shot so
that's also part of the reason why he's
had so much success when he moves
forward
[Applause]
yeah no hesitation is there recognizes
that he hits a good approach and he's
in he wasn't even going to come forward
on that initially but he hits his back
and watch this redirects it then sees
that Dio's on the full out stretch with
the open racket face and his speed is
just so good in the anticipation there
and shows off the hands with that angle
volley he's not too many service games
like that today after he hold to love in
about 60
seconds five G
second only Sebastian Gro on that AR Fe
has worked with in his very young career
even luic actually did a little bit of
work with the French tennis
Federation that was last year so
uh nice to call on someone like louic
he's also done some work with c as
well his dad there was his very first
coach the uh the man that got out to
Feast into tennis coached him until he
was about 12 years of age
third to
good pick up there from Dio I love the
Ser Vol up 30 love taking a chance there
right I don't see him making that play
at 30 all in this game but again playing
the score smartly done there and I think
that was a great pickup of even though
Feast did have a look at a pass
like a lot of times during this US Open
so far Adam we see a lot of players
anticipating the ball going out and they
almost sto playing I've seen it numerous
times
that's a big serve there from
di so guarantees himself a tie
break once again I to try and hold serve
too can just get as aggressive as he
wants here he's got a bit of a free hit
in this return
game 15 lock
third to Long
13 15
[Applause]
[Music]
LS for
service 15
been a good service game from AR Feast
plenty of first serves
made struggling with that first serve
percentage throughout this set just 13
of
30 yeah Fe has done a better job in this
set serving when he's behind in games
not when he gets
ahead so a tie rate required coming into
this match we would have been a little
shocked if we didn't a TI the way that
these two
[Applause]
serve least this year in tie breaks he
won six lost
five and Gabriel Dio all levels has 119
and lost 10 so those good numbers for
the Canadian in fact he is
one his last eight tie breaks wow Dio
don't tell him that now I know right
including one in the uh the final round
of qualifying
here 1 zer
[Applause]
he
but points after he gets up a break or a
mini break P he just kind of plays a
loose
point and doo didn't really do anything
special at that point there he just was
making balls putting him in play and the
forehand to me on the Dio side right now
is the one that in the big crucial
moments could get away from him a little
bit and feast hasn't taken notice of
that just yet
2 1 finix
that's what I'm saying Adam I feel like
that's the side that Fe needs to pick on
right now it goes into the backand of
backand Dio's backand has looked solid
throughout this entire match and
especially in these crucial a little bit
nervy
[Applause]
moments that's just a tall level by the
way those those tie breaks just to
clarify that's why Dio's
numbers that I was saying
earlier yeah 19 and 10 this year but
that's across all levels so challenges
as
well that is huge biggest of the match
so far
136 go some to get up to what we saw Ben
Shelton delivering yesterday finished
his match with a 141 mph race that's it
well he got it to what what was it 149
last year I think that's unbelievable
wow how about that depth in the
[Applause]
is going to get for crowd into this
one put your hands up at Fe you just a
standing o after that point what a tween
it he hit there after completely
misjudging it I thought he was in
trouble
here he had a good drive kept that low
too that was probably better than the
for pass he would have had I feel like
theow stopped playing after that last FY
though and left the whole line open
after right here or he just stayed home
watch this didn't really make that
recovery
step well he's a proper showman is AR Fe
he would have absolutely love that point
and sometimes it is just a point like
that that completely change how you feel
on a tennis
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
C oh my goodness
me you think he's pumped
there's nothing newor L more than the
showman how about this passing shot gets
pulled all the way back and hits that
Crossroad
[Applause]
angle well he's just been waiting to
ignite this crowd and that is exactly
what he has done consecutive points to
go 53
up
6 3 pleas
[Applause]
[Applause]
well that was a pretty special ending to
that tie break and the 24 seeds have is
leveled up this one out on Stadium 17 he
takes it on the breaker
15 block
couple of beautiful strikes on the
forehand to start this game off yeah
look the momentum's definitely on the
feast side right now but I got to say
for someone that's 6'8 like Dio
sometimes I don't understand I feel like
he plays like he's 6 feet right he plays
aggressive from the Baseline but he can
go for so much more early on in the
rallies I know maybe sometimes he wants
to get a feel and try and wait for the
fe's mistake if he's not you know
confident or not feeling it at that
moment but there's been a lot of
opportunities where I feel like he could
be more aggressive from the
back it's a great game from Feast the
ace the Big Y the tough conditions like
yesterday where we saw a lot of players
dropping a little bit and you can tell
if you if you got into a deep match it
was a complete physical battle
[Music]
[Music]
if you're going to let these you know
dictate points from the Baseline and
move you around you're going to get in
trouble if you're Dio that should show a
little bit of concern there for Marty
Loro
already the opening few minutes of this
third set just feel as though AR to
feces a little more dialed in in that
for hands
[Applause]
just got a real spring in his step here
to try and make a move straight
[Applause]
away probably didn't want that second
set to end really Feast just in terms of
the energy of the crowd he felt incred
incredible on the cord as well some of
the points that he was putting
together and that's big time tennis
there from Dio big serve into the body
and then he rips the forehand not
letting th get settled whatsoever he's
got to do a little bit more of
that easier said than done but again
needs to be more aggressive and not just
wait for feast to make mistakes now
because he's a lot more dialed in than
he was in that first set
don't job
[Applause]
1 13 yeah it's two second serve returns
Miss for Fe but I look if Dio really
wants to make a push here he's going to
have to increase a first serve
percentage you can't give Fe that many
looks at a second
serve and that was a great serve from
Dell as well proo shot got a little bit
unlucky clipped the Le Court to give Fe
a little bit more time on this passing
shot but you made him come up with the
goods you tip your hat there that's a
good serve and a good approach shot
maybe would have come into the back hand
but he's hit passing shots off both
sides so
oh that sounded off though I don't think
he's connected with that that was a
little bit of a mishit off the
frame still almost dropped in
that's another second serve return that
he's unable to make Gabriel di play
another ball there AR Fe he'll be
disappointed with how that game panned
out in the end from love 30
[Applause]
feel there won't be too much longer
before Gabriel Doo is a top 100 player
for the first time it's been higher than
129 down at 143 start of this week
at 116 in the the live rankings right
now is
dio and a win here he would be very
close to being a top 100 player
15 home
yeah those are the the rallies that Dio
has been winning majority of the time he
can get into the back end to back end so
solid off that
side but he's just held from love 30 as
Dio now he's got face in a bit of
trouble
[Applause]
five breaks of serve in this
match
come how would you assess what we've
seen for the last two hours Jesse a
little bit up and down from both players
I felt like the first set they were kind
of trying to fill each other out and Dio
got that one break and then the second
set they went back and forth yeah
breaking each other multiple occasions
in a row then the tiebreaker Feast came
up with some unbelievable points and the
the passing shots that he hit in that
breaker were were incredible and then
you felt like the momentum was
completely on his side but
we're pretty even right now to start out
this third set and both players doing a
good job of taking care of their service
[Applause]
games that is super encouraging almost
after every point he's either clapping
or he's up on his feet
just floated a little that backhand
slice from Dio and feast dealt with it
so
15
[Applause]
L that's more what we saw from Dello in
that first set higher percentage first
serve getting at least one or two free
points a game and look you're you're 6'8
you got to get some free points on your
serve can't rely on just a baseline game
the whole time even though he has been
very
[Applause]
solid he hasn't had too many games where
he's just kind of sered through him in
in you know I'd say two minutes or less
I this
is not going to happen every time but he
expect to have a couple of these a
[Applause]
set you kind of had a feeling that P was
going to try and finish that point off
in style yeah incredible tweener from
alter Fe at the back end of that second
set tie break two games on let's just
talk about this drop shot here from Dio
this was actually very good shot showed
off his hands but this volley here got
to do a little bit more he almost went
like forward hit like Top Spin on that
volley gave Fe a look at the showman
shot again he could have easily hit a
forand but down 40 love he says why not
I'm going to go for the showbo shot in
front of the crowd try and get them
involved again
it's kind of what you get from Fe just
capable of you know when he finds a
rhythm and he's feeling good on CT can
just be almost unplayable but then he
can just throw in cheap errors like
we've just seen there
as though it's concentration kind of
wanders throughout a
match before he knows it he's love 30
here
[Applause]
15 that's too good
129 right in the corner on the line
[Applause]
[Music]
and that return there Dio had a good
look on the back end just kind of guided
it in there letting Fe take advantage
again and dictate the point got to be a
little bit more aggressive on
that but well done there from Fe take
control of the point he's really been
moving the forehand around so well
throughout the match the back hands let
him down in the moments but he's hit
some amazing passing shots off both
sideso taking a long look at that
thought maybe it was just a little long
it was close
seen both players struggle at times
behind that second serve return
certainly off the backhand side fe's
missed quite a few
today is it harder watching or playing
watching for
sure you're not in control
on
dece got this
[Applause]
the same
Ser exactly the same one he dealt that
love 30 down in this
game so he comes through
move anything but
[Applause]
easy so the third set is basically
started as the match has developed so
far it's been very fiercely
contested neither player really has been
able to really get a strangle hold on it
[Music]
y you get on to face time to wind up on
that forand you are in big trouble
that's the shot right there that Dio got
in trouble the one that he tried to run
around hit a forehand just left it
sitting in the court and then Fe just
needs two shots to end that rally cuz he
really takes control of
it almost missed that one long that was
closer than he would have liked
last second service
it's probably l Point we've had all
match that LE Court a little bit threw
off fees on that the timing but that was
well constructed point from both players
doing a good job of staying in that
rally good defense from Feast to kind of
neutralize it but then Dio once he gets
those two sitting
forehand that's when he can really do
some damage on that side I do feel like
the forign is still the weapon for Dio I
just feel like you could Rush that side
that's the one he makes more
[Applause]
[Music]
on it's pretty big serving again I he's
averaging 121 milph behind that first
serve today he's got up to
136 it's one 35 of 46 points behind
behind the first
serve oh we've seen Feast do that
so often today second serve return off
that backhand Wing either missing it in
the net or
[Applause]
long so Dio holds comfortably
three games off so for Dio Jesse to make
the next step in his career and make it
inside the world's top 100 and
potentially the world's top 50 what
areas of his game do you think needs to
improve well I would say top priority be
the Net game because I feel like he's
got the pretty big serve he's to up the
percentage on the serve but if he can
improve that Net game he's just going to
impose himself that much more on players
he is aggressive from the Baseline he's
very solid off both sides but if he can
learn to move move
forward and feel really comfortable with
the volleys he's going to be that much
more dangerous he's 6'8 he has a long
wing span he's really tough to
pass
15 yeah we haven't seen him serve volley
too much today have we he's done it a
couple times when he's been up 40 love
in a game so he's doing a good job of
playing the
score just seven of 18 points one at the
net for Dio today
Feast has been great when he's come
forward 12 of 14 points he's w
kind of feel as though he can just sit
in that back court cross backhand
exchange all day
di very comfortable now with some good
change Ups Too shown off the slice back
and both players doing a good
job mixing it up there
[Music]
[Applause]
good
boy little opportunity here a little
opening for dio 15 13
[Applause]
go we're just talking about how solid
the backand is for Dio that was the
first really loose air on that side in
in a while
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
very sensible just to let that ball
bounce
14 it's a good first guess on this one
right here Dio got kind of got jammed
into the body but again fe's doing the
smart play letting that bounce waiting
to see which way his opponent's going to
go and then just rips it to the open
court
oh wow one of the best returns we've
seen all
match Marty Londo liked that
one now I feel like the crowd's going
the other way
thank you amazing that's his first
winner of this set for
Dio so that just went off the net I'm
telling you these nets are strung so
tight
[Music]
that's much better hitting there from
Dio those are that he can do on the
forarm he could be aggressive and put
more behind it sometimes he just kind of
rolls it in and then lets fees kind of
dictate and get a shot you got to take
it especially against a top player like
Feast he's not going to give you too
many
opportunities so first break point for
either player in this third set and it
goes to the Canadian
[Applause]
oh that was a
chance he's doing a good job of moving
forward on that wasn't so easy that was
low and short and the court didn't have
a lot of room to get that ball to go up
and down Dello trying to go right at
these to make him play that first one
would have been onew pass smart play
there that's a loose air there from
Feast cuz that ball was slow it was deep
in the court good return from di try to
neutralize
[Applause]
to a p the break point and this time
Gabriel Dio makes no mistake with the
bham
pass so Gabriel Dio looking Ultra
positive with his coach on his
feet now le arur is the Chan around
Stadium 17 as they look to try and get
Feast back in it wonder they know speaks
French too
[Music]
that's aggressive stuff there from diow
just with the doctor ordered after
getting up a
break I'm telling you that first war
that he got he just rolled it in but
when he got one inside the court and he
stepped in that's when he takes the
initiative and followed it
in can't wait for feast to make mistakes
after going up a break now you got to
keep your foot on the gas if you're Dio
[Music]
15 be desperate to avoid what we saw
from arto in the second set when twice
he went up a break and then in the very
next game he was broken back
[Applause]
[Music]
15 1
[Applause]
on
tough passing shot there from Feast but
again D picking that one
off that low approach really well not
trying to do too much and making Fe come
up with a tough pass and again that's
what I mean if you're 6'8 and you come
forward you're just imposing on your
opponent it's difficult to pass it's not
so easy you he has that wingspan
go
14 so first break point in this set for
feast
[Applause]
light first
[Applause]
service
that's couldn't have asked for a better
time to have an ace there
Dio right in the corner 130 mph I mean
come
on first stce of to set I bet you he'll
take two more of those right now
and fin yellow
[Applause]
massive Ace out wide to save the break
point massive Ace down the T to come
through the game and back up the
break G Le five five games to three
[Applause]
go try to give him a little bit of
advice
there sure if Gabriel heard
[Applause]
it great
if I'm in this game I'm going to be
really aggressive because might as well
take your chances and you feel better if
you go for your shots then you still
have that game to serve it out if you
play a little tentative you can roll
over
into into the next game where you have
to serve for the set so better to play
freely this game and try and let loose a
little bit and then serve it out if you
don't win it
[Applause]
so to me that's a tentative return there
from Dio 1
15 I haven't seen Feast serving voling
too much no certainly what he was doing
there
14 15
so Fe holds easily big fist p
over so can he hold his nerve Gabriel
Dio serving for a two sets to one lead
he has new balls as well to try and help
him through the
game couldn't have asked for a better
time to get the new balls as well well
Adam going to help speed up the serve a
little bit
but he dealt with the return
magnificently well and Then followed it
up with an inside in forehand again that
was s
deep that inside in forehand right there
that had some whip on it and some
acceleration and a lot of players
tendency when they get nervous is slow
down the racket speed but that time Dio
really whipped through through that had
some good racket speed behind that
forehand oh wow get out of
here yeah he's looking at the crowd on
that one has a big smile on his face and
he deserves it after that winner oh
Dello is feeling it this game wants the
crowd to get into it as
well oh he so the crowd at the end of
the second set going nuts because of
what ARA was doing out there rolls have
reversed here very calm nod of the head
from coach approval on that one it's
three set
points well the upset is very much
alive because the qualifier Gabriel Dio
goes into a two sets to one lead over
the 24 SE AR
what a way to close out the set as well
he takes it by six games to
[Applause]
four so two and 3/4 hours on the clock
he may need another couple of hours here
after Feast if he's going to make it
through to the third round who sets the
one behind land for service
15
so Jesse does he close this
out oh that's a tough call look if if
Dio really believes that he is going to
win this match and he can deal with the
nerves and yes he does I think at some
point in this set you're going to see a
little bit of inexperience and if he can
get past that then the floodgates will
open CU Fe is not going to just give it
to him I tell you that right now he is
experienced he's been in these
situations before 13
15 still a long ways to go here but
obviously Dio with the two sets to one
lead
will be a point in this set where if he
gets over that moment he will close it
out not twice before in AR's career has
he come from two sets to one behind once
was actually here 12 months ago against
Talon Greek Sport and also did so at
Wimbledon earlier this year against
Roman saulin
[Applause]
let second service
off and running in the
fourth big second half of the season
coming up for the feast not only here
but he's currently first in the uh the
race to jeda the next gen I don't know
whether he'll play it because he
obviously played it 12 months
ago this year it's actually a lot closer
to actually them heading to
Australia basically the week before
Christmas is the next gen finals this
year so I think a lot of players will
probably choose to play the the next gen
and then I'd imagine just go straight
down under to start the
season lost in the final there last year
did Feast to Hamed movich the Serb
[Applause]
[Applause]
15 15
[Applause]
Adam you were saying if I thought that
thewood closes out this is Uncharted
Territory for him obviously being in the
second round of his slam and now being
being two sets to one up and and I talk
about that moment there will be a moment
in this set where he's going to have an
opportunity to go up on fees and maybe
even break him and that'll be the moment
if he can get past that it'll show a lot
of
maturity not taking any chances on that
one might have been going wide but when
you have an easy overhead like that just
take it and put it away good hold there
from the Canadian
[Music]
s 15 lck
I don't like talking too much about
money but
$215,000 guaranteed to whoever wins this
match when you think that Gabriel Doo
this whole year has made
$241,000 so we can basically equal that
with one week's work
[Applause]
four to l
she sery he's been very good when he's
come forward today that's only the fifth
Point that he's lost yeah but again he's
doing it at the right time he's up 40
love playing the score just trying to
get a quick free point there
so nicely dealt with from
AR Sebastian GR
[Applause]
do
[Music]
yeah little little Le Court luck there
from Doo sending the apy that's the old
sorry I'm not sorry again we've seen a
couple of those this match
but good short slice here to almost bait
fees to come forward says Hey I want you
to come in so I can hit a passing shot
but obviously not planning on the left
court
[Music]
lost count how many second serve returns
he's missed today I mean look the diao
second serve has a lot of action on it
and it gets high up on on Feast but he's
standing so far back you feel like he
should be able to have time and and
the power to be able to put that back in
play he's missed a lot of those and Dio
taking
notice that's a tough shot there on the
full out run tried to hit a slow angle
drop shot not easy shot there from
Dio but again I'm impressed with Dio's
movement for a guy that 6'8 he moves
yeah really well and plays good defense
play little half chance for Fe here out
half chance I like that one not a full
chance just
yet this is where Doo needs to really
rely on the serve here needs a first
[Applause]
serve see if he takes a little bit off
and use that slider out wide if Hees is
standing far back if he's standing close
to the Baseline Doo is going to blast
this one up the T well he's back let's
see if he goes slideer out
[Applause]
wide her you Jesse
Yeah and another
one 14
[Music]
oh
and I talk about some of those moments
he's going to have to get through in
this set Adam this is one of them
obviously this isn't even nearly the
biggest one that he'd have to get over
the hurdle but needs to hold
[Applause]
here pretty Stone Cold calm face there
from coach Marty Loro showing no concern
don't want to relay that those nerves
he's got a good Poker Face there coach
oh
[Music]
that is brilliant wow it's so well there
di to turn that point around and how
about that angled volley to finish it
off how about the defensive lob to
neutralize that point cuz Fe was in
total control that
point and then he hits that lober
neutralize and once Dio got that fore
end notices to open racket face and that
was a great volley coming forward to
angled that one off great job there
cutting the angle off
[Applause]
I know that he can possess a lot more
pop on the for end than the backend side
but in this moment he's beating Fe in
the back end to back end rally so maybe
not run around every single opportunity
until you're really going to go for it
cuz then you can put that pressure on
your opponent that was just a change of
Direction on the for and if you're going
to go for the for and let it go get even
more aggressive with it if you're Dio
he's doing a good job putting everything
in play right
now he knows that Dio hasn't been in
this situation before so he knows some
moments he's going to get a little bit
nervy
and
P you see Dio peeking at with his eye
there a little side eye action seeing
the frustration yeah can feed off that
[Applause]
you see that
[Applause]
there's a good return there from Fe High
and deep in the
court almost jammed Dio there trying to
get around hit a for again is doing a
great job of staying in this game not
not letting Dello out
there's the slider out wide
[Applause]
[Music]
again yeah great time to throw in the
Ser volley that's Jess he said that is
one big moment in this four set ticked
off for Gabriel
Dio going be about three more there's
one that's smart play there from Doo
recognizing how far back Fe is and you
can tell there not completely
comfortable with his volley he almost
put that volley really far in front of
himself but just had to block it back to
the open court great job there from
Dio if he's going to keep keep the
pressure on him now got to keep taking
care of his serve
[Applause]
15 15 off
that so well
[Applause]
450 three aces in the game here for
[Applause]
feast look at Four Aces what a service
game that was
yeah immediately under pressure in this
game he just had to come through a near
10minute service game last time out did
the Canadian didn't actually have to
face a break point but Feast is
definitely just beginning to probe
yeah what a away with it slightly there
did
di that first for in that he hit thought
maybe was going to go long I think it
froze feels for a second but then Dio
does a great job of coming in Cross
Court and covering that line he had a
couple nice volleys there in the last
couple games realizing that he may need
to move forward more than he may be
comfortable with
but again putting the pressure and
imposing himself on fees 13 of 25 at the
net in the match for Dio but as you can
see there he's been good in this set
y actually thought that that approach up
might have been a tough one to come in
on but again still following it in he
wants to hear it for the catch sign him
up can't believe he threw it back in add
it to his waist coat you got to throw it
back it's like catching in a Away Home
Run you throw it back watch his
catch you catch one hand or two
hand oh no he didn't catch it a fumble
oh he stopped it
off the
bounds round for the
save 15
[Applause]
[Applause]
13 that had to be pretty close you can
hear the crowd's reaction to that yeah
[Applause]
yeah much easier service hold this time
for Gabriel Dio and we go three games
all three games all just waiting for a
little dip in the level from to Fe on
his serve in this set because the
Frenchman's been very good so far hasn't
missed too many first serves hasn't
dropped too many points really
[Applause]
[Music]
L
15 winner of this one remember to take
on the winner of the match between Max
pel and Tommy Paul and looks as though
Tommy Paul's just about to go two sets
to love up on pel
15 I'll be frustrated to miss that Dio
got into the
rally that's Feast off the off the hook
having won that opening Point as well
that's so good love the aggressive
return then the slice to get these out
of position and sees the open Corner the
back end aggressive back end down the
line really smart stuff there from Dio
showing that he can Implement that slice
the change up and the flat
backand really good
backand technique on the back end very
sound super smooth
oh wow just let that one
go that's really impressive aggressive
tennis there from Dio and Fe fighting
off that return that was deep down the
middle thought that he had a decent for
just left it sitting a little bit for
Dio and he just pulled a trigger down
the
line so two break
points that has been his go-to
serve certainly when he's been under
pressure Feast that flat one up the
middle on the juice Court
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
and Gabriel Dio is the first to break in
this four
set and the young Canadian is just two
games away from the
[Music]
oh that it's just a joke of the forand
from Gabriel Dio what a return
Fe he dealt with that so well and then
follows in the next
one he's realizing if he imposes himself
in the net that he's going to have
success but sees that Fe is on the full
out scramble there with the open racket
face you got to follow that in he does
just that great finish at the net for
Dio
there again yeah how many second C
returns off his backand as he hit into
the net
today and that is why he is just glaring
at Sebastian
Gran thank you Dad realizing that time
is beginning to run out
that's another great serve from Dell and
this is exactly what you want when
you're trying to close out a match here
you want those free points on your serve
especially if you're a little bit nervy
right now and he's focused right now in
the present can't be getting ahead of
yourself at all been impressed with the
way Dio has handled this fourth set so
far 14 15
[Applause]
[Applause]
L for service
oh wow out out I heard the out call was
out here
yeah 14 this game has suddenly just got
a little more interesting and it looked
like it was going to be at 40 l
[Applause]
there any please thank you
yeah very important to find the first
save there and he moves to it in a game
of round three new balls he's going to
get the new fresh racket now Dio wants
to get that little bit more control when
the new balls come out and remember Adam
we were talking in that last set this is
a crucial game for Dio obviously Now's
the Time that he wants to be really
aggressive because if he does have to
serve out the match here yeah he wants
to be free and feel good about it and
not hold that tension inside if you play
a tentative game here just trying to
make balls that's going to carry over to
the game where you have to try and serve
it out so look for him to be aggressive
in this game see if he can hit out some
some nerves but he hasn't showed any yet
I again super impressed with the way
he's been handling this
[Applause]
that a some pass we got the way into a
close from Dio yeah look and if your
fees
here you got to do everything you can to
hold serve here because you know your
opponent hasn't been in this situation
ever before and you got to try and make
him serve it out
wow my
goodness look like he's playing an
exhibition rather than serving to stay
in the US
Open he's got the crowd on their feet
for sure
Fe that one I felt like D should have
hit but he was trying to get over his
head he didn't have the right grip so I
think that that was just a
reaction about the first volley that
Feast hit off the
return this is just the Game Feast wants
quick hold to
love good positive body language
fromat on Slam for the very first
[Applause]
time L first service
[Applause]
just love the way he's played that
opening Point how good is that serve to
start out this game here to try and
serve out the match these are the
moments Adam that as a kid you you dream
of and you're in that situation now and
if you're Dio trying to serve it out
night match at the US Open Full House on
Stadium
17 you take one point at a time this
is this is where dreams are made right
here all out on that followup forehand
as
well wow
those are exactly what you want right
now you want those free points he's got
coach up on his feet after each point
right
[Applause]
now looks pretty calm but I tell you
what he's not inside right now but he's
doing a great job of masking that
I got to tell you Adam it's almost I
know Dio is a big guy and he's 6'8 but
you're witnessing a boy become a man
right now this is a massive moment in
Dio's
career and he's handled it with absolute
grit y
what did his coach say to you earlier he
is a tough cookie showing it right now
three match points watch the emotion
from Dello if he can finish it
[Applause]
here the heart rate jumped up there a
couple couple beats per minute there
he's going to reset
[Applause]
thank you thank
you well it's the biggest moment of
young Gabriel Dio's career so
far he is into the third round of a
grand slam for the very first
time and he does so by beating the
incredibly talented friend benman arter
Fe incredible scenes in his camp and
it's not going to get any easier because
it's Tommy Paul
