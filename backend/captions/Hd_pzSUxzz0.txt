ready
play 5 left
[Applause]
15
[Applause]
on sun serving wi shouldn't be a factor
from Andre rublev's side it's a little
bit behind ARA
riges right now and a little bit of a
breeze in the
air and days this warm the ball is
really going to be moving out there good
days for big servers and big
hitters sometimes the players will
string the rackets a little tighter
flatter hitters will string tighter
Spiner hitters will actually go a little
looser we may see quite a lot of that
today from arur Andes I like that play
actually he did a lot of that in the
first round looked at the end of that
match Christopher Eubanks he was putting
a ton of pressure on Eubanks to come up
with big passes and I like this play
right here taking away you know the
baseline from an aggressive player like
rubla really taking it to him
early she has a taller guy very
physically imposing when he comes
forward very popular figure as NE
Andre
rev results this year started with a
another title in Hong Kong and a
quarterfinal at the Australian Open
quarterfinal in Rotterdam quarterfinal
in Doha semi-final in Dubai that's where
he was disqualified you might remember
in that unbelievable match he was
playing with Andre bublick got a little
bit upset with himself just let his
emotions bubble
over he did struggle in his next four
tournaments wining just one match but
then he responded with
another title in Madrid is second at
1,000 level a third round Roland gal
Lost first round of Wimbledon
semi-finals of umag quarterfinals in
Washington DC and a final in Montreal
ladies and Gentlemen please as a
courtesy to the players remain quiet
between first and second serfs thank you
for a quarterfinal in
Cincinnati so very good year for Andre
Ruff 37 wins 22 of them on this surface
please
[Applause]
please look like there's a clear plan to
be aggressive on these second server
turns from render NES like a pretty big
swing at that forehand seats quickly
please behind the courts thank you all
kinds of things going on here on court
17 Andre r a little bit thrown off
facing an early break
[Applause]
point just looking at those results Mark
it's not been a bad year at all is it
for rupv
coming off a good win in the opening
Round Here against Thiago cyber
[Music]
V Advantage Ress
[Applause]
not happy with that wristband right
there he's pretty wound up
already just very much where his heart
on his sleeve doesn't he
rubl so it's a second break point
[Applause]
and man it's rubla
a strong ending to a difficult game for
Andre
rev
first NES one of 14 Frenchman in the US
Open main draw this year that's the
second most by a country of course
behind the United United States and one
of three
arter left in the competition along with
Fe and want to watch Caso
[Music]
[Applause]
today playing his fourth US Open is
rendes best is a third round that was
last year
40
love he said Mark the players want to
keep the points nice and short on this
hot day R doing a good job so far
one game
[Applause]
off no matter where you go they're
always hardcore French tennis supporters
love 15
oh
yes a massive forehand swing there
NES as soon as he saw that toss kind of
going behind the head you can see wind
NES getting out aggressively outside
that double out to crack this insent in
forehand good shoulder turn nice contact
out in front pretty compact swing on the
forehand
there he's come to play today hasn't he
NES 153
really has been a reliable Contender to
reach the second week of Majors recently
has rublev though Advanced the
quarterfinals in three of his last four
appearances here at the US
Open hasn't faulted in the second round
of any major since 2019
but facing more trouble now
[Applause]
30
40 you know these aggressive returns
make or Miss I actually feel like
there's a lot of value there because
rendes is being really disruptive you
know he's not letting rublev Play points
and kind of get into rallies find a
rhythm that eventually could lead to a
little bit of inconsistency
saves all four break points to him this
game
de yeah these kind of points are the
kind of points that rublev would prefer
to play a couple balls across he has
plenty of time to change direction up
the line start to resemble almost a
groundstroke drill and that's right in
his wheelhouse you he's going to try to
expose the legs of render NES and those
kind of points
that's a short second
serve
ADV just inviting pressure as Andre rub
and one of six behind a second serf
[Applause]
brilliantly
d three
Aces that's a big team these day is
Andre R along with Fernando vente and
Alberto Betto Martin who also by the way
has a double role as a
psychologist Marcus bordas there in the
Rev Camp he's the fitness trainer our
coaches play multiple
everybody has to do
everything you got to be the bag carrier
Haven you the court scheduler make sure
the water and the foods right the
towels and ultimately be a shoulder to
cry on and a chef
good
catch
this shame you have to give them back
really isn't it
[Applause]
very deep from R National an ultimate
shot and
reres reres is a pretty flat ball on
both sides he's really taking advantage
of this quicker court on 17 I think it's
one of the quicker courts around the
ground Ball's really scooting
[Applause]
[Music]
through so fourth break point in this
game sixth in the match
already and this time he converts
an early break of serve for the T
Frenchman he's dialed in and leads two
games to
one he was never beaten a top 10 player
in his career with an early break of
serve
love
[Applause]
15 good start for rendes he generally
wins 80% of his service games but less
than 10% of his return games that
numbers just up a little this
year thr in the drop shot a couple of
times already successfully
[Applause]
today she got up there pretty quickly
for a big guy
[Applause]
thir underutilized serve there the body
serve especially against good
returners they use it a lot in doubles
don't they but not so much in
singles perhaps that is changing
interested by this quote Mark you can
tell me from a coaching point of view
Sebastian out during the points thank
you the coach of uh AR rindes says the
goal is not being top 10 in the
world but just scratching the guys above
him he
said interesting I'm curious the you
know the context of that maybe it's kind
of setting small realistic goals and
sort of continuing to kind of chase them
down and seeing where that takes
you you said there's no such thing as a
good or bad draw in tennis the strongest
are not strong all year round the
weakest are not weak all year round the
right draw is when you win the match the
most important thing is to give yourself
the means to win sounds like a deep
thinker I like it
come on
gamees was turning out to be a good draw
for hter ringes
3-1 leads three games to one first
set is that the way you think as a coach
you know it's funny a couple year when I
was working for the USA back in the day
with one of my supervisors we were
talking about a player and he wanted me
to tell the player that he had a bad
tournament and I started arguing
philosophically about what's a good
tournament what's a bad tournament I
think it just is it's not good or bad it
just is and so yeah I kind of see it
more there with Shades of Gray
and understanding the game that
way love and don't forget you can uh
stay connected to the US Open Facebook X
Instagram Tik Tok YouTube and WhatsApp
join the conversation with # usop
30 l
oh what a
forehand
15 I was curious how he was going to
play this point after missing the
previous second surf where he tried to
run
around but showed clear commitment right
there you predicted a lot of short
points in the warm up Mark and that is
what's happening
[Music]
oh that's an incredible try
volley R still a little bit of odds to
himself it's nicely there this time to
15
15
[Applause]
love talked about Andre rupv good year
but it's been pretty decent as well for
ARA riges 33 wins so
far that is a combination of ATP Tour
and Challenger events
so first round he lost at the Australian
Open made the quarterfinals of the ATP
Tour event in
Marseilles champion at the Le Challenger
he's had a lot of success on home soil
has rendig NES quarterfinals of Leon
second round at ring garos semi-finals
recently in Atlanta round of 16 in
Washington L forf and then a round of 16
in Montreal from qualifying where he
beat Flavio
cabal most recent tournament round of 16
at Winston Salem
[Applause]
305 a lot of first serves for Rend NES
so far and sort of setting up the rest
of his
game help him keep these points nice and
short
[Music]
[Applause]
30
[Applause]
off NES two of four behind his second
serve
now couple of first serves might be
crucial here
lights for surf
so first chance for rublev to break 304
[Applause]
what a commitment to that
forehand I have to say Mark I've done a
lot of r n matches and I've never seen
him so aggressive off the ground
I I think it goes back to the idea where
if he doesn't step out of his comfort
zone if he plays a lot of points like
this rev is just going to be better than
he is you know trading ground strokes if
he can take the upper hand early in the
point make rublev defend then he can
play points more on his
turns wasn't the worst choice in the
world I think just was a little too far
back to hit that drop
shot this rally of the match so far 14
shots this
game going over the 5 minute Mark now in
the brutally
heat of Court 17 there is no shade
just wonder why arur indiges doesn't do
this a little bit more perhaps he will
if he's successful here in particular
[Applause]
Advantage
r a little quicker conditions to really
reward players for playing that game
style you know if you're playing on the
gritty courts in akapulko giv no matter
how aggressive you are the other players
going to be able to get there get the
ball back maybe reset the point so
there's not always the same risk reward
where
back to juice we go this is a very tough
game randri actually hit a pretty good
second serve I thought he had a nice
chance to hit the forehand to the open
court played Too Close to the middle and
gave yeah rublev a chance to get back in
the point
[Applause]
coming up for eight minutes
now the players don't get a sit down
after this
game nice quick points for rendig
Nash
R second Ace for the Frenchman
holds surviving the two breako chances
for Andre riff lead four games to two
first
set 4 two
[Applause]
there's the team of R yeah they're
allowed
every and a little delay I think that's
because Spectators are a little in at
the side of the
courts what a forand there full stretch
love
15 Mak incredible effort to get behind
this ball with his back leg but to send
it up the line have a pretty loose hand
to hit that one with that much
Pace he knew that was good like how good
was
that I think he said o la
la 15 got the fire baby we got the fire
not a day for Andre rublev to waste any
negative emotion on needs to keep it all
contained another massive forehand from
render
15 I mean I think rublev needs to start
moving the second serve around a little
bit more too many balls going towards
the body or the forehand side of render
NES that's often being pointed out
hasn't it as the weak point in the rubl
game the second serve Why do you think
he hasn't improved it I I can't I don't
know why he hasn't improved it I'm
guessing you know it still has to do
with maybe a comfort kind of thing like
there's a lot of players who really do
these things are not as good at they do
them great in practice but actually in
the match the execution there's still a
little bit of mental block
perhaps it's just a
guess and is the Second Step problem
that it gets too predictable is it just
that it doesn't have enough spin on
it you know it's a little predictable
but the big problem is that it lands
pretty short in the Box he starts
leaving them short there's not as much
spin it's not bouncing up and away from
the opponent
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
4030 126
mph four
a
227 km an hour if your mind thinks in
that
way lad for surf
got some length on that second serve
Onre
rff looks a little hot and bothered but
he's still in this opening
set need to get a break soon people
use ATP still requires there to be
sawdust at the umpire's chair it's in
the rule
book little known fact
not allowed in crickets not allowed
no I think some cricketers in the past
have had illegal means in their pockets
to try and scrape up the balls to make
the baseball too ah okay they use like
Vaseline or sunscreen or different
things
yeah hopefully we're not getting to that
point in tennis
[Applause]
love 30
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
come
on 1530
[Applause]
first Ser percent just dived a little
bit for arter rig Nash faced a couple of
break point chances against in his
previous service
game managed to save both of
them that's a good angle from the r left
back hands
[Music]
1540 couple mistakes here when rublo
actually changed the Rhythm instead of
you know hitting at that same
speed shape the ball used that spin to
create you know get the ball into the
third dimension outside the sideline
[Applause]
that really took
[Applause]
off e
[Applause]
yes indes this year on tour has been
winning about 50% of his second serve
points today it's just a little below
that at 45
Advantage
R the racket's been close a bunch of
times
doing well as near just controlling the
emotions it's been coaster bubbling over
a few times a little surpris r NES
decided to volley crosscourt probably a
ball you want to just keep right in
front of you go short right in front so
you're in position for the next
ball another lengthy game
break point number three coming up in
this game for Andre
rublev just needs to keep knocking on
the door doesn't he eventually he'll get
one
not this
time going for the right shot there yeah
I don't mind it
oh
unbelievable
depth Advantage
rublev well finally rublev was able to
find that reres backhand he hasn't had
him playing too many backhands Under
Pressure I think that's where he's going
to try to find some short balls on the
backand side
hey hey
and there it is it's taken Andre
Riv 46 minutes but he's got the break
back crowd on court 17 acknowledge his
perseverance I didn't think the break
would come when serving with new balls
did not see that
coming
Rees gave a lot of second serves to
rublev had a lot of looks at second
serves that really helped
double f as well was let to go love 30
down put the Frenchman in a bit of a
hole one he could not recover
from so back on level terms
love 15
[Applause]
L for
surf help
we've seen that forand
before 30 this is a 69 mph second serve
and that deserves to be handled that
way on average R has been winning 55% of
his second serve points that's for the
year
1530 today it has been much lower than
that as he gets a point on the board in
this game from love 30
GL for
surf
3 double the H tally of his opponents
30
40 great Point Chance is coming thick
and fast now
[Applause]
and this time the racket does take an
absolute smashing Andre has been broken
for a second
time lead
[Music]
and R NES will get a chance to serve out
the first
set L for
15 LS
30 LS
[Applause]
[Music]
305
[Applause]
here we
[Applause]
go let's go
[Applause]
a well constructed point from AR ring
dig NES 57 minutes the
Frenchman has two set points
[Applause]
[Applause]
40 30 that rubl for him was one of the
first balls probably this game that he
had a chance to hit balance Rand Kesha
did such a good job of keeping him off
balance keeping him from getting
comfortable
[Applause]
set point number
two and this time he gets it a terrific
set of tennis from the 29y old playing
the US Open for only the fourth time
15
left so Mark the game plan for Andre
riev here in the second
set got to do a better job on second
serve either make more first serves or
try to put a little more emphasis on
location on the second seres direct some
balls to the back can
corner and see if he can break the legs
down of R try to extend the
rallies 40 low or just hit Aces I mean
that's works too that works
[Applause]
also eight for the match now
J R and a perfect service hold for Andre
nice and quick as
[Applause]
well 15 left it's catching
30 I think they both had a little
discussion in the break in the bathroom
just let's hit Aces let's not run around
too
much 40
loves sometimes we see that in some of
these best of five matches on a hot day
where both players kind of find that
Rhythm making a lot of first
serves return games going by a little
quickly 40 15
[Applause]
Sebastian vet also coaches Manuel G
that's how they met actually Ren ner
completed four years at Texas A&M went
back to
France good friends with
G play little doubles with him and then
joined on the three go around the world
together
oh what a forehand from Andre
rublev
this rer really Tred to inject some Pace
into this rally left it a little
short nice quick turn there and
acceleration of the racket head Andre
rublev
ADV R took him 3 hours and 49 minutes to
get the better of Christopher Eubanks in
the opening round for ARA
riges had a day to recover 108 he won
that match in the final set tiebreaker
[Music]
he
[Applause]
hey deuce
just wonder if that might come back to
haunt him a little later on in this
match if
it goes longer than straight set
[Music]
[Applause]
nicely handled half fall just kept it in
front May he's in position for the next
ball nice racket work on the volley
keeps the racket head above his wrist
perfect backhand
volley he lost one point when he's
ventured towards the net harded
NES G apologize for the net cord we've
seen quite a few of them on cour 17
today game a piece
just getting those Watchers ready yeah I
was thinking
ahead would be surprised if he was going
to douse himself in
it 15 love
15
on another share of frustration for
Andre r we didn't see it but certainly
heard
it it's a spectator
down we'll have a bit of a waiting
period here Andre puts his racket
away I'm not massively surprised as a
spectator down there is no shade on this
cour
ladies and gentlemen play is going to be
temporarily stopped until the medical
emergency can be
handled so hopefully the umbrellas will
come out for the
players it is just brutal out there if
you're just joining in 15 or in the
third game of set two
[Applause]
30 15 I think that kind of thing can
help someone like rublev in this
situation you know we saw him there
chatting with the Umpire in kind of a
relaxed way can kind of just bring the
tension down just a little bit
[Music]
does seem to have a dial doesn't he and
once it goes past a certain point
there's no comeback he can
just keep it below maximum level he's in
good shape well and render NES has come
out and sprayed two balls on the other
side of that
oh it's great defense from arur rendes
Andre riev keeping his
call for first reres now hit seven
winners off that wing and Lead n 2021
seven quarterfinals or better on the ATP
Tour
[Music]
love
15 one of those good runs for rended NES
UR in Leon H to his first in t level
events on Clay beat Yanik sin in the
second
round a little bit of acceleration here
from Andre rff Love
30 yeah last couple points really
testing the legs from reres seems to
kind of slowed down the tempo of the
[Applause]
feet great return good direction you
know kind of to a big Target pretty
safe took it really early didn't he
looking to take time away see what he
can make of this love 30 start
love
[Applause]
4 undercooked attempted drop shot from
the
Frenchmen and it's R who gets the first
break points of this second set
1540
[Applause]
30
40 so 21 Aces against Christopher
Eubanks in that five set Thriller the
other day it's now seven for the match
and the break goes to Andre rev and he
lets us all know how he feels about
it blood leads three games to one second
[Applause]
set I like the adjustment you know
directing a lot of first balls the
rallies to the render
backand getting short balls as a result
very quick up to that
forehand I think everyone in all five
bars knows that Andre riev is happy
of course he did break didn't he the
rindes serve to get back on track in the
first set need to be broken right away
must be careful
[Applause]
here love 30
[Applause]
[Applause]
1530
[Music]
he
[Applause]
rev looks just a little bit quicker
defending those you know those big first
strikes from rendri
NES R just a little slower since coming
out of that long break
we've seen him make that shot today but
this time it's a
net a chance for ares to break back
[Applause]
immediately usually on a ball like that
maybe out of the corner of his eye he
saw Rea gesh staying put
a
a oh what an incredible point of the
tournament just absolutely laying it on
the line leaving it all out
there
37 shots on an absolutely scorching day
we're in between two airports and the
noise from Ur rindes every time he hit a
shot made the plane sound very quiet
he's down but hopefully not
out and you actually wouldn't want to
lie down on this court 17 cuz it's even
hotter this was an extremely physical
rally Andre rublev testing the legs of
rer NES actually heard the tone of his
grunt change over the course to that
point as he became more and more
tired want to know what his max heart R
got to
there look it might be in the red let's
just say
that back to juice
I'm not too surprising that R NES misses
the forand still short of
breath did play four years at University
of Texas A&M conditions there in the US
South very very like this
[Music]
just got to go for
[Music]
break this
[Applause]
Advantage
[Applause]
Ru I've had a couple of retirements this
Wednesday due to injury rather than heat
stroke but still Bastian bers out and
Alexandra
sevchenko oh just blew that forehand by
[Applause]
Ruble render NES not super eager to get
into any more protracted
[Applause]
rallies no more 37 shots is that what
you're say it's not in the game plan
regardless of conditions though that
wouldn't be you know how you want to
play Andre
rublev it's amazing isn't it the red n
has get more forand winners today than
rublev has 12
to9 you think of Onre real BL you think
of Mr forehand
[Applause]
another break point chance first we saw
that unbelievable
rally the second quite a bit shorter
[Applause]
Advantage
[Applause]
Rand rub actually quite Keen isn't he to
get on with the next point he sees his
opponent suffering here he's coming off
a straight sets win in the first
round
LS second serf
[Applause]
[Applause]
come
on Advantage redness
I'm impressed with the rukes ability to
sort of recompose
[Applause]
refocus about four or five minutes ago
he was lying on the
ground now he's got another chance to
break and not this time either turning
into a huge game now
it's either going to be 4-1 rublev or
back on serve 10 minute Plus
game and he's missed
[Applause]
it oh that one hurts you have an open
potentially for a short forehand but
plenty of
[Applause]
time hit it right to the guy then you
mess up a volley he's not even going to
run
[Applause]
for just got too
[Applause]
casual and he's missed the forand so it
was worth the waits for arur indiges
breaks on the fourth attempt in that
game game which involved a 37 shot ran
saw this man flat on his
back but he's broken back and we're back
on Ser just broken back after to a quite
terrific resilient
display 15 left
[Applause]
[Music]
got
oh 30
[Applause]
Lu Albert Martin dishing out the
instructions to
RI just looks a little disillusioned
once more doesn't he
it's like best case scenario here for
rer that's a quick
game game have one of those in a
while three games all second level three
a piece
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
well it is not a set down
but taking
them take the
opportunity just going to sit down a
little bit I'm 29 years of
age did have a love holds in his first
first service game of this match now
he's had
[Applause]
another Andre riev serving with the new
balls this
time love 15
15 off
[Applause]
[Music]
1530 rublev just has a really hard time
hitting that second serve into the
backhand corner on the de side
[Music]
[Applause]
1540 just lost his way hasn't he the six
seed you can see the body
language going down a little bit
more 30 40
[Applause]
so it's both great
[Applause]
points turn coach Fernando
vente comes from a very sporty family
rub dad was a boxer Mama a tennis
coach and V
[Applause]
it's broken three times today so far AR
indes on the cusp here of a fourth
[Music]
as started with a good second serve from
rublev render NES didn't have a chance
to set his
feet that let ruv start a point exactly
how he wanted getting into the
backand keeping reres off balance
we left now with 23 total winners 11
have come off beforehand
that return whistled back at
[Applause]
him been too many straightforward games
for the
server first serve
I think that's called grip it and rip
it Advantage Ress
just held on H for the best landed
in someone up there got a
[Applause]
souvenir breako number four they keep on
coming 15th of the match for arur riges
15 and he takes it thunderous
forance AR riges recovers from a 13
start in this second set second set and
now he's on the front foot
[Applause]
hey hey
so committed to playing on the front
foot see the point star neutral but this
one was this backand that he stepped in
and drove through that outer third sets
up the inside
out probably pattern number one in the
modern game strong backhand crosscourt
get a weak reply and go inside out big
oh
15
[Music]
[Applause]
30 a little bit more Breeze in the air
which will cool down just a
fraction with some extra Duty
balls being used on the men's side of
things here at the US Open in singles
anyway use the regular Duty balls and
the mix
doubles 30 Mr rubl is requesting
replay it is electronic line callings
there's nothing that uh Andre can do
about it just wants to see where the
ball landed clearly doesn't agree three
[Music]
30
40 now break points right back for Andre
rublev he's converted two of nine in
this match so far
[Applause]
help
what a serve from rinda
unbelievable what a kick serve she in
this weather you can really get these
balls moving the Wilson US Open ball
naturally is kind of a bouncy ball but
it really starts going on days like
today
good wheels from Andre rev another
little racket Shake Break Point number
two coming
[Applause]
up look like r m was in control this
point it's a makeable volley just kind
of lost the technique a little bit
it's a break back for Andre ruet a
set which is turning out to be a roller
coaster ride which way will it end up
four games
all was difficult to tell isn't it Mark
one player looks exhausted then the
other then the other looks a little
brighter and a little bit happier and
then the other person person breaks
back had a bit of everything so
[Applause]
far how do you do in the coaching
situation watching if if one of these
players is yours how are you feeling
right now yeah not
great take a couple deep breaths and
rely on my morning meditation to stay
cool but it's tough to watch you know
that the players are out there suffering
you know the conditions are tough you
just want your player to okay keep going
one point at a time try to really narrow
their focus you know if they come into
your corner
especially just try and keep them up
yeah don't judge just keep keep on going
cuz the other person is as just as up as
down as you are
[Applause]
oh that's twoo
[Applause]
Goods 1530
look at the depth in that return right
off the
[Applause]
Baseline I love that play on the second
serve returns go big middle
oh these two are warriors absolute
Warriors 30
all you just wonder about the state if
whoever comes through in the next round
[Applause]
R winning the majority of nine shot plus
rallies ryes looking to keep as short as
possible he's having success with that
when R was throwing in a second
serve or not as the case may be 340
[Applause]
seems like both players are having
harder times when they're serving more
effort required
[Applause]
seems the best corner to watch from
doesn't it right near ARA rindos in the
shade there a nice
spot just
long Advantage ru
it's got to the case of the Jesse pulas
and Maes do NE Andre rev quarterfinalist
at all of them but no
further oh Jesse Pula taking a stray
bullet up here today
jeez well maybe this is the year they
both going to break through we shall see
Andre riev holds after saving another
break point opportunity and now he's got
his snows back out in front
54 two sets yet here on court Stadium
17
[Applause]
15 this is Wayne ferrera's take on how
to beat Andre rublev attack the second
serve don't let him camp out on the
backand side attack his forehand and
expose the backhand wing
[Music]
rnes has done a pretty good job of doing
that
today that was not the swiftest moving
I've ever seen from arur
R the question mark is going to be you
know how's his body H up over the course
of this match you mentioned the previous
five Setter with Chris Eubanks that was
a night so it wasn't you know terrible
conditions but we know how these New
York kns obviously can be kind of steamy
out there and it was still 3 hours 50
minutes wasn't
[Music]
[Applause]
it 15
[Applause]
W's father former professional boxer and
he looks a little bit like one right
here can he deliver a knockout punch so
[Applause]
30
home go Arthur let's go
[Applause]
L for
surf passive Point coming up with arter
riges serving four five in the second
set 30
all break points Galore in this second
round match
took a lot of time in between first and
second the first serve dumped into the
net the second a little long a set point
for Andre rff
[Applause]
St
an incredibly brave from arur
rikes I mean what a gutsy play with his
back probably physically up against the
wall pretty good pick up and he covered
the line just like you're supposed
to back in volley racket stays above the
hand nice angle until the Open Court
[Applause]
first service deserted him
and vage Ru set point number two for
Andre
[Applause]
rublev it becomes very difficult to
serve as you lose your legs right here
rer needs to take his time gather a
little bit of that leg strength try to
explode up and hit from that angle down
into the
court an incredible shot from Arthur
indes she wants to hear he Some Noise he
wants some love just saved second set
[Applause]
points that second serve keeps getting
shorter from R but this was just a
massive forehand probably 6 to8 feet
behind the
Baseline just pure ball speed
[Applause]
candy it's hard to hit a winner from
there wow
much needed first serve there makes life
a lot
[Applause]
easier he's dug himself out of a big
hole here arur indiges for five
all Sebastian vet looking on rather
nervously another seven plus minute game
a phenomenal strike this time off the
backand side for arur indiges it's been
an incredible performance from two
absolute Warriors five games all second
set
where is he gaining that kind of energy
from it's just
[Applause]
incredible that's about as well as you
can strike a back hand up the
[Applause]
line I would look for him to be really
aggressive on the rublev serve take some
big swings on return see if he can steal
a couple points I think that's what
Vette was telling him just standing up
shouting a few
words I think he was
listening love
15 let's go Arthur go
[Music]
[Applause]
15 that's a part of the court I think
rublev can continue to try to go
to using his back end up the line just
gets you out of that kind of predictable
pattern when you're starting cross
that was his first backand winner of the
set only two for the entire
[Applause]
[Music]
match what a shot what an angle
he's good at doing a really good job
isn't he aring firing up the crowd
[Applause]
here so nice getting on the outside of
that ball he does a really good job on
the back end forehand he hits it kind of
straight you know but the back end he
can get on the outside and creat some
angle
[Applause]
I'm not quite sure what Andre R's upset
about
[Music]
154 what we do know is
that he's facing two more breakpoint
chances
[Applause]
[Applause]
be an acceptable mistake that one for
arur
indes hiso is to
strike hard and
often and then take a seat when he needs
to got to play of course at the service
Pace that is the rule in this sport
working
sparter and
harder good body Ser there one of the
first body serves actually we've seen
from rublev so inter a couple good ones
earlier but that was one of the first
ones from rublev
[Applause]
the big guys don't like returning there
when you jam them long arms
he is 6'5 1 me 96 arur indiges that ball
wasn't quite in the spot and he takes
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
advantage break point number three for
the tall Frenchman
[Applause]
winning just about a third of his second
serve points throughout the match and
he's broken once more
Serv I don't know why the microphone's
not going right we hear
you it sounds like we've lost uh the
electronic line calling so Greg
allensworth shouting extra
loudly the fans let them know they heard
him I can hear you up
here one down three to go
15
[Applause]
left the energy the momentum all with
this man the 29-year-old from France he
was briefly his country's number
one let's first serve it's been a while
since that's happened of course R NES
overtaken by a few others
what a
feast just one of
those 30 LS
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh massive for
him for love who just found some extra
energy hasn't
he out of some Way's been asking the
crowd to get behind him they've duly
delivered and so is he three set points
for arur
rendes game and he know need one of them
an unbelievable set of tennis which took
no less than 83 minutes and Arthur
indash is one set away from beating
Andre ripet for the first
time four years ago at Roland garos when
he beat Sam query 63 in the fifth set
15
[Applause]
left 15
all might just come down to attitude
might it for Andre ru does he still
believe does he still want it
enough and then on the other side of
course K indes keep up this very
aggressive play
38 winners now from the
Frenchman he ranked the sixth best in
his
country oh massive forehand again from
rer NES probably 8 ft outside the
doubles
alley absolutely smokes a forand inside
in
30 40 cannot afford canny Andre Riv to
get broken in the first game of this
third set
[Music]
this
Advantage Rend just trying to find that
back
[Applause]
can a lot of times these double faults
are almost accumulations of the types of
returns you've hit over the course of a
match and that's certainly one of them
get a little
payoff
this third break point comes and goes
for arur and
[Applause]
ignes and vage
R so nine Aces for the match for Rubble
six double fults
game rev and Andre rublev survived from
1540 in the first game of set three
love 15
little opening here for
rublev love 30
[Music]
[Applause]
L for sir
been on court now arter indash for well
over six hours this match combined with
this first round win over Christopher
Eubanks 3 hours and 49 minutes that
[Music]
took just wonder how those legs are a
feeling right about
now love
[Applause]
[Music]
40 a big finish Andre R and it's he who
has the early break in this third
set to love for the six
seeds rub BL leads two games to love
third
set just a huge forehand there and then
more importantly a huge game swing that
momentum
[Applause]
[Music]
not been pleased by a couple of
calls thought he saw that one long
30 what a streak here for ruet
30 15 that's what you call commentator's
[Applause]
curse seven doubles today
[Applause]
[Applause]
405 and a brilliant service hold in the
end for Andre rev he's got the break in
hands three games to love third set nice
lead in this third set third set against
Arthur riges from
France he has a three and0 record when
winning the first two sets in
matches 15 l
[Applause]
15 home
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
1530 nice angle there but Ruble back
with an angle of his
own render next looking like he might be
into energy conserving
mode you really have to think this is
going to be a a must hold isn't it for
Ry NES Wonder at love four down double
break if he would possibly just move on
to set four and start
again there's a chance of that chance
that rubbled will break for a second
time in this
set 30 40
let's go let go AR let's go let's go AR
let's go
[Music]
[Applause]
but not yet this
[Applause]
[Music]
wow Advantage rendes this has to be a
little bit of a boost for render NES if
he can get out of this game he put some
pressure on rublev to you know do what
he's been doing take a couple big swings
on
returns game kick Ser the 94
mph Ru leads three games to one third
set M get himself on the board here in
set

wanted to thir absolutely exhausted
doesn't he but still the will to win
continues a love hold for the six seed
and a 4-1 third set lead
[Applause]
just looks a lot more sprightly doesn't
showing the
energy love
15 actually looks more relaxed too in
the
face kind of positive energy
this is bad news for arur indiges just
that last forand and the look at his
coach a look slightly of resignation
wasn't it
oh
just misses
153 majority of matches today have gone
straight sets but have been two that
have gone the
distance including
one of which yishi leka coming through
it and he will be the opponent for the
winner of this one
[Applause]
1540 and surely these two points as good
as set points now for Andre Rev
30
[Applause]
40 hopefully is suffering with that
right arm Rees certainly didn't show it
with that Ace is 11th of the match
game of R it's a scorching
forehand Andre R breaks for the second
time in this third
set
R he'll take it
broke for two LA and now for 5-1 serving
for set
three indes continues to take as much
time as he
can 151
looks like this set is all but
[Music]
over 30
love have you ever seen that before I
have uh the fans don't love it
I think you should just hit it and wait
please miss
it just like that 40
love H are from the New York
[Applause]
crowd three set points for Andre rev
don't hold your breath anyone think he
might do it
[Music]
game and third set RB so four set six
games to one coming up very soon on
rendes deciding not to put any effort
into that final game
[Music]
just ran out of energy didn't the arter
indes the end of that third set he was
broken for a second time and decided not
to put a huge amount of effort into his
final return game the momentum Martin
lero with Andre rublev
yeah I think so and that's the question
is coming out of that 10-minute break
what's reender NES going to look like
how much effort is he going to be
visibly able to put into
his to his tennis at the start of this
set
[Music]
30 start here you'd imagine is going to
be very very important for one of these
players
help
[Applause]
153 39 breakpoint opportunities between
them within the first three
sets 10 conversions
[Music]
[Music]
and more opportunities coming
up
15
40 yeah pretty successful when he was
been able to go behind R all starts with
establishing the Inside Out forehand
riges has had the trainer out treat a
right arm
problem game rev and it's Andre rublev
who breaks for a sixth time today fourth
set that could be very important in
his chance of coming all the
way 15
[Applause]
love the other Advantage for Andre
rublev is that he hasn't fed in the
second round of a major since
2019 31
it was that man query again who defeated
rev at Wimbledon that
Year 4y love
game rublev a nice straightforward holds
back to back love holds in fact for
rublev R leads two games to love fourth
set
coming for straight sets win against
Thiago cybot
vush Andre
riev feeling a little bit more confident
right now
15
left if you're the coach Mark of arter
Andes at this point what would you be
telling
him it's tough cuz you see someone who's
probably physically
compromised just ask him to you know
give everything he
has you know do whatever it takes to
stay out there really I mean 15 all you
try to get them in the right for in mind
and then you talk a little bit give me
one tactical thing hey look for your
forehand you know when you get a
forehand and you get your feet set go
big pound it similar to what he was
doing in the first couple
sets 30 15
30
oh rup have plenty of time there to pick
a Target and rip it
there no positive signs are there for
arur ressi only positivity really is
that he's got two sets in the bag
he just looks like the fuel tank at this
point is very close to
empty game r
double break for Andre
[Applause]
rublev stretching and reaching and not
able to get his feet anywhere near in
position love
[Applause]
[Music]
15
15 yeah Ru can't relax too much you know
you still have to do something can't
just lay balls in the middle of the
Court got to have some purpose keep the
intensity up
305 overall in his mind though rev's
mind SM what will he be feeling do you
think right now confidence you look
across the net and you see someone who's
kind of spraying balls maybe doesn't
look that
great then that happens and like what is
going
[Applause]
on this is very possibly the only thing
that rended next can do right now
anything in that
[Music]
wheelhouse 40
[Applause]
30 Shake of the head probably tells us
everything we need to
know game of r
BL consolidates again for love R leads
four games to love fourth

nice serve into the body again good use
of that
serve little better job getting a speed
in place and some of the forehand
unforced a as we saw
earlier in this
set
out one ahead in the winner count Arthur
and ignes 44 winners for him 43 for
rublev Frenchman does have six more
unforced errors though throughout the
match 40 l
[Music]
40
15 game
redes new balls
please four games to one four what he
can right
leads two cents to one stay
competitive times Mark it's not easy to
play someone who's visibly fading is it
because you just sort of let your guard
down a little bit you can get kind of
pull down with them but looks like right
now Ru love is managing creating his own
energy
15 is it important to treat your
opponent like they're playing as well as
they can and not think about that I
think you play you and the ball it's
just right now it's me in the ball
that's what I'm going to try to focus
on someone like rublev you know he's
been there before since he's not a
rookie out there he's you know been in
this position s trained to be in this
position 40
[Applause]
18th Ace from
rublev game rev another easy hold ticks
off rublev leads five games to one
fourth set game away from a deciding
fifth set
[Applause]
15
[Applause]
Love Now 51 down in the third set after
indiges gave up the game he was
receiving on that occasion looks like
he's putting a little bit more effort
into this
one 3 love
on
40 love try and ask Andre rubb to serve
it
out game
rindes rindes has done what he can do
behind surf rublin leads five games to
two four sets rendes leads two sets to
one
behind the
second and looks much much fresher than
his opponent right
now 50 left
15 the second service when he's forced
to reach render conect actually could
get lot of pop and a lot of length on
that
forehand 1530 and a little bit of a
glimpse here for indig NES
[Applause]
not taking any time in between points is
he
[Applause]
rublev
1540 this match has been full of twists
and turns if you've joined us from the
first points
there may be more to
come 30
[Applause]
40 did a great job creating space to hit
that ball got out of the way
quickly saves two break points from r
has been broken five times
today L Nash in all has had 24 break
point
opportunities this will be a set point
rather than a break point Advantage Rev
[Music]
[Applause]
this can't convert back to juice
[Applause]
good dig out of the corner from r a
pretty big return another big
return set point number two
and this time he does finish it off six
games to we're going to a fifth set here
on with the man from czechia yishi leka
[Music]
any he want Andre R come back from a
love two set
deficit four years at R and garos when
he defeated Sam
query you got to manufacture some energy
here regardless of how you feel got to
have a little bit of energy to make one
push here
[Music]
looks like uh R's whole body is going
into cramps
yeah watching r m at the end of this
point after he hits his back end you can
see him stiffen up and kind of
[Applause]
wobble M has been broken
his first service games of both set
three and
four there's the number behind though
nine shots or more rallies Ruff winning
and no surprise that reres gets a Time
violation he has been absolutely making
the most of those 25 seconds in between
points
153 wonder if that might just get him a
little fired up here
[Music]
[Applause]
couple good deliveries right
there he's got to take everything put it
into the serve get up on the scoreboard
early there a winning record in five set
matches arter indes four wins three
defeats when major matches have gone the
distance
here at the US Open he's won
both one of course here in the first
round against Christoper
[Music]
Eubanks 30 40
[Applause]
oh not by much
[Music]
there R had a good look at that
forehand here R NES your goal is see if
you can make ru play some points of
consequence he hasn't had to play too
many meaningful points in the last two
sets you know the level was very up and
down the first two sets try to get back
to that position
it's more in line with the style of play
he was utilizing the first couple hours
out here
Advantage proactive with the feet early
in the point looking for big
[Applause]
forehands right now looking for the
least fluffy ball one that he can get
the most power off
back to juice we go anytime they get
into a longish rally it goes the way of
rublev
[Applause]
now the ru Rhythm off the ground looking
pretty solid
Marcus Bas we've seen him in the crowd
there in the team of rondre rublev he'll
be pretty happy because he's the fitness
trainer of the world number
six there he is in the glasses with the
white T-shirt and the right red strike
arter indiges summering up some kind of
energy from somewhere it's been missing
for the last two sets
[Music]
just
wide and so for the first time in three
sets arto riges does hold his Opening
Service game that is going to be crucial
to his hopes of progressing here and
beating a top 10 player for the very
first time
[Applause]
15 Lefty
[Applause]
15 she thought rublev missed a chance to
use that inside out forand I think if he
would have gone behind rinder neck he
would have had another ball maybe an
easier ball to play into the Open
Court a number 20 for Andre ruff
and now have 102 total winners between
them these
two that a great forehand from rublev a
little extra spin little extra shape to
get that ball to run away from rinder
NES cem nor said about the forehand of
Andre RI it's got the best forehand in
the
world it's really tough to get him
moving be the one to be aggressive and
dictating not bad too one game
more one game on Final
[Applause]
set I've said he sees parallels between
him and Carlos alcarez and they both met
the perfect coaches at the perfect time
he say Fernando vente who we met at 13
years of age changed the way that rupv
trained before it was a lot of hours but
not in the right
[Applause]
way oh that was a close one
[Applause]
very very back of the line
[Applause]
15 long
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
does look like arur Ines looks an awful
lot better physically right now how is
that
possible you know you don't see people
kind of donate two sets and save up
their energy usually you'll see at the
one set little rest save the energy but
in two sets this would be remarkable but
he also know and this is go time right
here if he doesn't stay on serve early
he won't be able to put any scoreboard
pressure on
rublev he's just going into the reserve
Locker isn't he
[Applause]
rendes but you also see a finish time in
the fifth set you see like the finish
line coming up and you know okay I got
to hang tough however long it's going to
be 20 to 30 minutes but then we're
done I think we might need a couple of
stretches here on Stadium 17 cor but
that's a big reaction from arur
indiges he's back in the running back in
contention 10 Frenchmen in the world's
top 100 right
now 51
oh what a serve
there love time for a fresh stick
[Applause]
holding up
G ret and just like that ret levels it

pop in this fifth

Defense AR indes runs out of court runs
out of steam it's fabulous from Andre
riev he backs up the break and now two G
four games to two final set I mean what
an incredible get there huge effort from
rindes but just not enough Andre
rublev in control right for the first
time
[Applause]
[Music]
today look down and out didn't he
physically exhausted after losing the
second set emotionally as well right
[Applause]
AR indes paying a heavy price for that
opening round win which lasted just shy
of four
hours wasn't quite Dan Evans Karen HOV
territory but still
51 just continuing trying to hit big
[Applause]
oh that caught
59 there we go 4H hour mark simply
superb match and where both players have

not
much high of
92° 33
hey oh what a pass from
ru
[Applause]
1540 you can feel render trying to like
you know make the energy happen trying
to put a little pressure on him but just
an outstanding pass left leg behind the
ball and a big vomos to his
Corner seven backhand winners in the
match now for rublev two more break
points
[Music]
Andre ruv saving the best for last in
this astounding
match and he's got a double break in
hands this match is surely going the way
of the six seed he's been just
stupendous and it keeps serve for the
match against arur rindes this
astonishing second round encounter 51
and if you were hearing him during the
break he said to the doctor I've drunk
too much I've eaten too much I feel like
I have a little baby girl in my
stomach one thing's for sure Andre
rublev has a lot of desire in his
heart looking down now after set two
which he lost 75 an 84 minute
Affair but he's found enough energy to
summon up a huge
comeback he's really been able to ride
this first serve in this fifth
set withstood a big push early from
reres
and we're going to have one more twist
in this thoroughly entertaining match
[Applause]
40
30 these two played out a four set match
in the third round of the US Open last
year this time it's gone the
distance but it looks like it might go
the same
way game set match R second time in the
career of Andre ruv that he's come back
from love two down in a major
championships
he gets the better of arur riges in an
unbelievable Jewel here on Stadium
