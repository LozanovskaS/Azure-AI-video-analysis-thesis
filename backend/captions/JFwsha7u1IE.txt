ready
play wasaki in the near Court this is a
first round match here on Stadium
17
15 since coming back from being a mom
we've seen Caroline be really selective
with her schedule which is not something
that we saw from her when she first was
on tour
let
Cerf 30 LS
49
quickly out to 40 love here
wazaki made her US Open debut in
2007 yeah that's a strong start for our
two-time finalists
here first game you and I were kind of
in awe of the going to take Confidence
from qualifying three three setters as
we mentioned including over former top
10 Christina
movich 15 and now's a feisty competitor
she's been on tour for several years she
knows how to compete she's going to stay
engaged in every point
love
30 question will be can she maintain the
consistency needed to overcome Waki
40 well putting extra pressure there
habo this is the first time they've met
but wasaki famous for that return and
already out to a triple break Advantage
here in game two
first point of the day for habo
15 saves one of now three break points
she's going to have to track down in
this game the
29-year-old from Japan
game well Christina that one flies on
her so wasaki here with a dream startaki
leads by two games to love for
S we were wondering how waki's arm was
going to hold up given that she has the
tape on it but it's been a great start
so far for
her there's been a few niggles for her
there's David Lee her husband she had a
left hip issue earlier this year during
the grasscourt swing also an injury she
picked up Midway through Indian Wells
when she made the
quarterfinals she actually said in the
last week that my body has not
cooperated 100% and Christina you'll
know well when you get into your 30s
she's now
34 she's not in well plainly she's not
in her 20s anymore I think it's been
something that's been more challenging
for Caro than she might may have thought
it was and of course for years now
dealing with the rheumatoid arthritis
which can flare up for her really at any
time even just how long it takes you to
recover from a long match the next day
the feelings of soreness when you're 18
early 20s you can go all day you can go
the next day and not be feel it but as
you get into your 30s as you said you
start to feel it more
oh set it up well there habo but maybe
didn't cover as well as she would have
wanted on the net and this has been a
dream start for Carol and a nightmare
nightmare for now look at that and
actually 11 to1 overall in points played
there's habo opening her shoulders on
that backhand and that's the side for
habo her backhand side that she takes
more risks on she can kind of penetrate
the court and she'll need to take more
risks like that against Caroline
today got smart tennis from w Aki who
consolidates the Break 8 minutes in
she's c a
three games to we're in day two of the
main draw here on Stadium
17 can that be an answer there for now
to move forward a little bit today she
does possess the ability to come forward
she plays a lot of doubles now so she
does have that ability to move forward
take time away from
Caroline feel that she's going to have
to do that now because from the Baseline
Caroline's just too
solid yeah and has not found her range
habina look at that unforced error count
it's a lot of what wasaki can do to you
on the
court what was the word you use
nightmare
yes I played Caroline too many times did
you
yes a little opening for hanino to try
to get on the
board 405
[Applause]
40
30 Abino trying to get into the second
round here at the US Open did so in
2017 hasn't won here since play her
first US Open back in
2016 came through the qualifying which
is a feat in and of itself this
year where hino's ranking is at right
now she's had to play a lot of
qualifying this year so it's something
that she's used to sort of working her
way into a
tournament that's her longtime coach
habina she's worked with him since she
started on the tour got takauchi there
loving the bucket hat
style love sun protection I'm all for
it this is a game now where she's let
two game points slip away
though kind of pressing herself and
that's the
pressure that Waki applies as she looks
to go up a double break 12 minutes in
game so Waki indeed goes up the double
break here 40 you can see the clock
there 13 minutes deep this is a dream
start for Waki runner up here in 2009
and 10 years ago in
2014 you can stay connected with us here
on the US Open Facebook X Instagram Tik
Tok YouTube and WhatsApp join the
conversation the hashtag is simple # US
Open 40 here for was in just 14
minutes 10 unforced SS the count for
Hino that's the stat I'm circling
Christina curious what you're looking at
here here
too that's for sure the story of the
match so far the unforced errors from
Pino I think it's largely in part to
knowing that she's playing someone like
Waki who is a grand slam Champion is so
consistent gets into your head a little
bit that's our longest rally so far of
the day that 15 ball exchange aino
dumping a drop shot attempt into the
net you know trying to up the pace here
and w y he is matching her shot for shot
gosh Caroline did such a good job there
holding the Baseline she was taking the
ball on the rise that's something she's
been looking to do more of since she's
come back on
tour three points for five love
405 is there a good time for a double
fall 40 love feels like that's a four
love 40 love feels like best time to
throw one in first of the day wasaki
will be really happy with her serve
number so far too
five love Caroline W serves one Waki 11
of 11 habo just three of nine that's how
we've gotten to this 5-0 score line in
18 minutes
played Stadium 17 our scene for this
first round women's match on day two of
the
open that feels good first winner of the
day for now
habo now I would really be hoping to
just get on the board get those Jitters
out of the way get that first game and
sort of relax a little bit heading into
the second set
a lot of these errors so far coming off
of the forehand side of hibino and
that's the side that can break down a
little bit more than the
backand and is it timing it looks like
she just hasn't found her range yet
today yeah it feels like she's missing a
lot of them long
that was well Tracked Down by wasaki
those balls can be tricky off the net
cord 15 30 this one popped right up
Carol was on
[Music]
it 30
[Applause]
that's just such good tennis
wasaki picking her targets not over
hitting earns a set point with that
ball 21 minutes this first set
firsts where's
the first set in hand Waki doesn't lose
a game husband's happy and so is
Caroline six love over now
habo now habo just chatting with e
takauchi her longtime coach that is
legal trying to make a set two game plan
they've got to start fresh here in the
second
set love the
[Applause]
team Christina curious over these next
couple points what would coach takauchi
there he is loving the bucket hat still
what would he perhaps be advising now
know to try to turn things around
here I think her coach would be telling
her to work the points a little bit more
and then choose her moment to come in I
like the variation there that habo used
a higher ball to the Waki backand I
think that shot could be beneficial for
her
15 3
30 is Waki someone who likes a lot of
Rhythm like if if she can habo pull in
or throw in rather some of those off
paace balls yeah that would be a good
variation get the ball out of the strike
zone of
Caroline she's really got a try
something different now because what
she's doing right now is Caroline's just
too good on every
shot it's playing into the wasaki hands
and we've called out the serve has been
really an asset for Koo today follows
that one in with the swinging backhand
volley winner this was a love 30
game game will four points on the TR for
the
Dane it's got to be a little
demoralizing for now given won three WTA
titles she's been top 60 in the world
but wasaki is just kind of tightening
her game around her like a python like a
snake I love that comparison yes it's
slow but it's
lethal see what habo can try to turn the
tide here
you're right though from the outside it
might not look like a bunch of winners
and sabalenka type game or raka but it's
just a Relentless pressure that you feel
that she is not going to give you a
point yeah what about that stat on our
screen winners to unforce erors
love
[Applause]
30 15 30
just wonder Christina is this what habo
can do to try to open those shoulders
more injects power with that backand
that was so much better there from now
she stepped into the court with her
backand and those are the type of plays
that Caroline struggles more with when
the the opponent takes time away from
her so that's the play for habo try and
take time away from Caroline
oh wasaki did tra that one down habo
waiting for it and for the first time
today she's got a game point
good coverage here nice drop volley
there and then stood her
ground thatle just feels so good for now
habo on the
board one game on second set she'll be
sighing in relief when you're down 60 1
that first game that you can get feels
so good big ex big exhale
you were saying too now habo is just one
of the nicest sweetest human beings out
on the WTA she really
is won her first WTA title back in 2015
she's got three total
habo including last year as a lucky
loser she came through to win the title
in
Prague that was last July brought her
back inside the top 100 for the first
time since 2021 cabino she's slipped
back out of there just in the last
couple months hence the qualifying and
ITF events she's had to
play 15 L that's just been a little bit
of the struggle for now she's has the
level she possesses the weapons
especially on the backhand side but just
not consistent enough in her play and I
think that's why she's been inside the
100 then goes back a little bit then has
a good tournament so just not enough
consistency
let for
Ser I think you know as well as anyone
the consistency is such
a maybe the hardest part of a pro tennis
player's job the week in and week out
bringing your best
oh great stuff from habo there wasaki
had control of that
point you were we were talking about the
physicality for wasaki but the the
mental piece of it as well week in and
week out oh she's incredible at that at
that especially when she was number one
in the world just to be able to bring
her level week after week
it's a little bit where habo has lacked
in her
career it's interesting cuz you have
some top players that get to the top of
the game by
huge massive weeks but then the lose
first round for a little bit and then
another massive week but Caroline's not
been like that she's been someone that
kind of is just consistently shows up at
the with the same level pretty much
every tournament especially when she was
in her
prime Waki we mentioned the US Open 13-
one in first rounds and then you pointed
out to me 47 and seven in major first
rounds little point of contention here
at 30 all after habo is able to finally
get on the board in that second game
[Applause]
40 yeah habo wants that
backhand take two floats just long on
her game point now for
aaki yeah you hear that come on Caro
holds has yet to be broken hasn't faced
a break points two games
to ranking wasn't high enough but she
actually said that
it um took some pressure off of her
shoulders habo after playing in Rio and
the Tokyo Olympics in
2021 she wrote in Japanese now it's time
to make my next dreams come
true yeah that's a nice point it can be
so interesting you know yourself as an
Olympian it can be so interesting for
these players what it means the Olympics
and that was a big goal for her but she
said now that it's passed tobino that
it's she can sigh some of that pressure
away I can't imagine the pressure of
being a Japanese athlete at the Tokyo
Olympics I could understand why she said
she feels now that some a weight has
been lifted off of her
didn't do enough there with that drop
shot Hino
good news for habo is that she seems to
be striking the the ball much better in
this second set and we've seen her use
that variation now of a higher forehand
down the line to Caroline's backhand
[Applause]
yeah now Christina just wants to hang
around toino try to get another hold
here continue continue to try to put
some pressure on wasaki
Waki controlling that approach shot
really well that was a tough ball
yeah she made this one look easy the way
she got up to that ball she has such a
quick First Step
Waki here's a fifth break point of the
day
that one that one called by the by the
chair umpire that wasaki didn't get to
it he said not up which is a double
bounce it's pretty good hands by habo to
control that half volley yeah wow that
was beautiful
touch
de here's the column will not up yeah
second bounce
indeed yeah you're right that pickup
pickup ball from habo was
incredible that's nice stuff from hanino
and she kind of fist pumps with the
racket I like that she's willing to take
chances here habo she's willing to mix
things
up she possesses great volley she plays
a lot of doubles habo
56% of first serves in today she's not
happy with that
[Applause]
stat does not get the feet set on that
backand this is our longest game of the
day
help
Advantage was the
empty well those were some of the
unforced errors or the kind of unforced
a as we saw from habo in that first set
and wasaki really looking to build an
insurmountable lead here a set in a
break has not faced a break point today
the Dane
game was and the double fault from habo
so frustration building there as Waki
takes a 31
lead in this second set

oh w picked the cross cour and hanino
Helder
grounds love
[Applause]
15 she got a bit lucky here but she did
guess right habo put herself in the
right
position 5 nice serve up the te there
Christina you and I are looking seven of
10 habo at net today just wonder if she
tries to get in
more seems like she is making more of an
effort in the second set and she is
winning seven of 10 points at the net
five of six in the second
set let for the trouble is though with
wasaki is when and how do you get in
because she's so solid and she loves a
Target to pass
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this is the part of the afternoon when
that sun can be right up in the place
play's eyes on that
toss never understood how some players
could play without a visor or a hat with
that sun right in your face like that
couldn't be me you always Rock the visor
right oh I had the visor and I had the
heavy zinc application of
sunscreen good skin
care 4 well this is just veteran stuff
too Waki gets the break and not really
close fourth game and now just continues
the service numbers they've been strong
today couple game points to
consolidate she can just see that Finish
Line in the to
car there's the frustration habo belts
that ball out of Stadium 17
wasaki in control has not been just
waiting for a couple fans to sit down
direct behind the players thank you very
much Nick mccarville alongside Christina
mcale Christina as the second set goes
on I'm curious from your perspective can
wasaki make a run here can wasaki fight
for another major title at some point
she's 15 months into her
comeback what I'm seeing from Caroline
today looks very promising she's looking
vintage Carol right now and I like that
her second round if she were to get
through today would be against Garcia or
zarua I like her chances in that
match 15 I think the challenge though
for wasaki is she's got to do it
consistently for seven matches and then
looming for her in the third round is
rabaka who totally blasted her off the
court it in she doesn't love the grass
Caro mishandled there by habo but she's
got to play almost the perfect match
Waki against a big hitter like
rabaka it would be huge if car could get
out of this match quickly save energy
for those matchups that you're talking
about that are going to be a lot more
physical battles
well that was a virtual Match Point here
wasaki has opened up a sizable 51 double
break second
second we've only played 50 minutes here
Christina gosh if you're Hino you're
thinking about just getting to the hour
mark Waki Camp giving nothing away but
they're pretty happy with this so far
today this could have been a a tricky
match for Carol but she's just played So
within herself today serving for the
match that's so true she's played within
herself she hasn't you know done
anything so out of the extraordinary
just she's played her solid
game vintage Caro I like that phrase you
used that's a compliment by the
way I haven't seen many of those but
that is the strength of habo she does
possess that ability when she connects
right with it
[Music]
no out 30 15
that balls in that ball on the Baseline
Waki two match
points just 52 minutes into this match
[Applause]
G
much what a win for wasaki complete from
start to finish the two-time finalist
making easy work of now
habo six love and 61 that score line
isn't lying
