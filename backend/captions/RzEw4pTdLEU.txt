[Applause]
carlos alcaraz
oh
he says his favorite favorite shot is
his big forehand got a heavy spin on
that shot but he's got a nice drive on
the back end it's a very clean
compact stroke in that two-handed
backhand
his favorite surface is clay but i think
his game lends itself very nicely to the
hard courts
[Music]
150
it's taking about 30 seconds to settle
down
18 years of age
you're playing thirty third
in the biggest court in the world
second point of the match you pulled out
uh tweener that's not a bad
way to settle into your surroundings
pretty good tweeter too really didn't
have another option it wasn't it wasn't
uh what do you guys call it showboating
timed it sweetly didn't it
brings a lot of energy to the court this
guy
[Applause]
we've admired so much about alcaraz for
a decent period now
we haven't seen too much of him in this
kind of
environment playing the very best in the
world on the biggest show courts the
biggest tournaments
[Applause]
forehand into the back end of pass
try to rush him a little bit
exactly the play right there if you can
get him to catch the ball late you'll
get some unforced errors he'll have to
go to the slice
well how about this two minutes on the
clock spaniard with a first break point
produce this meeting between these two
first of a few you would suspect there's
dad on the left patrick or toggle on the
right that's what tits pass does
a fair amount of his game development
[Applause]
dispatch academy versus academy with the
juan carlos ferrero academy behind
alcaraz
juan carlos
alcarez's coach
second chance for an early break
[Music]
18 year old from spain
first game
and as if we needed any further evidence
of this guy's pedigree
i mean
it's a lot to process isn't it this
guy's 18 years of age this uh one carlos
ferraro has been alongside
alcaraz since he was around 15 years of
age
very much part of the project of
building
that's huge guy to have in your corner
carlos great tactician
those guys knew how to change
from defense to offense extremely well
something that we're seeing from alcor
as often in his matches
that little play that we just saw him
taking it into the forehand side
before attacking the backhand
force him to pass you on that backhand
is a good play
[Applause]
difficult to believe when you get
courtside watch this guy i've caught the
last few games of his win against cam
nori who's interested to see
how he deal with
one of the guys who's been the form
players this season cameron nori from
great britain lefty
knows his way around the hardcore he's
got that tricky background
that stays low but alcaraz was so
impressive last few games forehand
was enormous playing so aggressively
that's what surprised me for a guy
who
perhaps so far has played his best
tennis on the clay
and that's exactly what he wants since
he has to do it
forced to go to that slice if you could
deal with that shot i have opportunities
this slice just a little bit too short
there's a
bullet oh
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
perfect start then
world number 55.
[Applause]
two-handed backhand it's so solid
talk a lot about his forehand and some
good evidence of how big it is today but
the backhand
is setting up a lot of opportunities
[Applause]
smart player
often find ways to get back in matches
has the game to play all court tennis
very good at the net
i don't know lee though if that kind of
strategy is going to work point after
point 15
against alcarazta
[Applause]
wow
15 40.
[Music]
it's interesting i was watching sits a
pass
after that ball landed
body language as if he couldn't believe
what he's been seeing so far in his
opening nine minutes
this is one of those matches being
pass still young still one of the up and
coming now one of the best players in
the world but this guy there's a
pressures on boss in this match
out i think we leave very difficult to
deal with his own tv
all of a sudden the pressure shifts back
to you
of course he's been dealing with it for
a while against his fellow players but
this guy 18 years old it's a different
kind of pressure playing the young guy
[Applause]
so quickly no reaction
from jcf
double break already athletes by three
games to love first sets
well it's been quite incredible the
opening three games from the 18 year old
double break
and a three love league
[Applause]
these two players moved into the third
round to pass with the wins over andy
murray that five setter then a solid
victory against adrian mannarino the
french lefty
with impressive wins over cam nori and
straight sets and the frenchman rinder
knesh
this is just
i mean
all right he has lots of point on his
serve yet i'll tell you another
incredible stat sisyphos is serving at
86 for surfs
86
and he's stopped him to 42 so far on
points one that's
all right
the level continues
training winners i mean this level is
this looks like a video game right now
who's controlling alcaraz out here
amazing
[Applause]
gonna have to in this set at least take
some chances i think hit the ball a
little bit bigger if he can get a hold
of it
he hasn't had any opportunities yet it's
a good return there
once more
[Applause]
this is the biggest tennis court in the
world remember
the big big crowd
apostolos looking a little uh shocked so
far
a reminder that you can download the us
open app to follow all your players
favorite players track the latest scores
stats highlights player news and more
that's available in the app store
and google play store
nice little change of direction that's
forehand there
stretching it out with that angle
so one of my favorite things is to do is
to try to read tennis players it's
always been something that i've done as
a player
when i was coaching as an analyst and
the face that alcarez brings to this is
that's just that dangerous look he looks
like a dangerous competitor he actually
reminds me of his favorite player
reminds me of rafa
and sort of that nod that he gave to see
as they kind of walked back after the
coin toss it kind of stuck in my head
there i was like okay this is
i've seen this before
this respect that you pay your opponent
and then go out and
you know do your thing
it's just so impressive to see somebody
do it at 18 years old
[Music]
good offensive tennis there 49. the
number three seed
he knows it's important to
assert himself here at the end of this
first set regardless if he wins it or
not
try to get some of the momentum going
into the second set
uh
[Applause]
15.
[Applause]
that's winner number eight
only the one unforced error so far
[Applause]
a double break
[Applause]
it's been a sensational start to the
match
from the teenager let's see whether he
can
keep this going up a double break four
one
oh
[Applause]
bit tougher to do anything with that
slice it stays so low
[Applause]
at least when you're approaching
i do think that result the semi-final in
winston-salem was major for the
confidence of outgress on
on hard courts especially coming into
this event
for service
loves the clay the french open he says
is his favorite event but he says this
is his favorite city
these fans are gonna start to love him
keep playing tennis like this
that's what struck me when i was
courtside love that tail end of that
victory over cameron
pretty big crowd around that court
a few spaniards in there as well getting
behind the youngster but you get the
sense that there is uh
you know every time he arrives in a
maybe at a new event where you get a new
fan base they want to get a look at this
kid news is news is spreading fast about
just what a talent he is
imagine a large proportion of the fans
inside ash this afternoon we'll be
watching this guy for the first time
good defense there
certainly no stranger to having to play
defense from time to time
such a smart player
chance for him to get one of those
breaks back
perhaps make alcarez think twice
we get him out of his zone a little bit
he's been
pretty impressive to get up that 4-0
let's let's service
let's for service
let's
for service
ah
that shot there
15 14. shot that he hits extremely well
that's that clay pedigree knowing when
to hit the drop shot
see stefano's playing pretty far back
defending some good defense in this game
in fact
drop shot's going to be available he
hits it quite well
okay
a nice moment
despite dropping serve
out for leads by four games to two first
set decent reaction from sit to pass as
you would expect for a
player who's growing in experience at
this level
just felt a little shell shocked after
those opening four games
he almost did look a little shell
shocked he's he's kept to himself pretty
well pretty well composed so far in this
match though and now he's giving him
some itself some opportunities and he's
changed some momentum here
the look on his face has changed
slightly looks
a little more determined
than shell shocked now
[Applause]
some good success going to the forehand
corner if you can get the ball deep
enough
over in that forehand corner of alcaraz
negate some of that firepower
[Music]
[Applause]
1000 champion this season for the first
time as well that was in
principality of monaco monte carlo
[Applause]
managed to achieve that first earlier in
his career
nato atp finals in london
good stuff
so after losing four straight games it's
the focus
chance here win three in a row
semi-finals coming into new york those
two masters events in canada and
cincinnati
make the last four at both
[Applause]
our christ deals then with this uh to
pass resurgence
in that 4-0 a double break
things are not tighter now but still
with a single break of serve
oh
[Applause]
jump up the rankings he's made in around
a year or
so amazing to think that uh the rankings
24th of august 2020 was outside the top
300.
on the brink of the top 50 now it's been
as high as 54. so one spot better
than his current ranking of 55.
nice defense there in the forehand
corner to see possibly beforehand
[Applause]
aquarius going for a little too much of
an angle there
oh played point nonetheless
[Applause]
[Music]
around late may time this year
was on the back of another uh challenger
title
spot just outside lisbon in portugal
on the back of that qualified iran
garrison made the third round
when you talk about moving through the
rankings i feel like awkward
play the challenger events the futures
events play the challenger events
don't play too many challenger events
somehow find a way to get through those
the fact that he won a couple and you
know really
put that stamp there and then get to the
qualifying as fast as you can and if
you're good enough to qualify
make use of it
[Applause]
[Applause]
by five games to three first set
so he passes that test
gets things back on track now just a
game away
from a one set advantage
[Music]
[Applause]
i think that was a mischievous
new york fan making a reference to a
bathroom break though
[Applause]
these fans are going to be behind
alcaraz if he continues to play this
well
partly because of the stuff that's
the little controversy that happened
with murray
just pulled up after that volley didn't
either slide
it's a little bit uncomfortable
it just amazes me the players these days
can slide like that
actually hurts my ankles just watching
them
it's a
mainstay of today's game
learning how to do it
oh
hmm
[Applause]
throwing himself at the ball often
maintains good posture when he does it
keeps things simple when he has to
it's a good return was a big serve
tricky second serve out wide
yeah that's one of those things you play
a set this contains
and then your opponent makes a little
bit of a comeback they start coming back
if you can somehow
hold again get those two breaks exactly
what happens here
the momentum can
[Applause]
youngster
[Applause]
what defense
[Applause]
that was a special
set of tennis
by six games to three
seconds
[Applause]
good to see
it doesn't seem to be too much of an
issue physically anyway for said to pass
so second set underway quite incredible
half an hour from
this spanish 18 year old
[Applause]
just continues to impress me that he
doesn't really have a weakness
and he can volley a couple of good
volleys keeps that racket out in front
so far he has taken the volleys kind of
cross-court he likes to get the outside
of that ball
be keen to see if he can hit it up the
line
but he's not afraid of coming in
that's huge
anything short and he's on to it
his favorite shot this big forehand
just the right amount of spin there
not too much able to hit it through the
court extremely well
[Applause]
the banter
starts between stefanos and his father
looked like your mouth that's your fault
[Applause]
second set
a relatively short break after the
opening set but uh
no signs of any loss of focus
for the youngster
well certainly
as much as it's been talked about
you need to go into a match against your
final sister knowing that it might
happen it's just
whether he'll do it or not
and frankly it's unfortunate because his
his tennis is always so enjoyable to
watch
but as a player
have it on your mind that might happen
and
how you're gonna deal with it
[Applause]
15
oh
[Music]
touch it up
carlos didn't quite get up to that
backhand
to execute the shot he wanted
[Music]
[Applause]
so
both players been successful when
they've been able to rush
their opponents forehand a little bit
every turn up the middle
pretty good one from alkaraz
not a bad option against pass
[Music]
some kind of stuff
[Applause]
quick to make up the ground
that's one of the things that juan
carlos ferrero is known for is that
backhand
so solid from all parts of the court he
could change the direction and out of
the corner very difficult to hurt him
clearly some of that bleeding off onto
alcohol as he is tough out of both
corners
[Applause]
uh
just
incredible stuff
the quality of the defense
the depth he was able to achieve
blink of an eye
pulls the trigger
this backhand corner
finally getting the shorter ball he
wanted
unleashing
he's not letting him out of those rows
not letting him get
a break
[Applause]
the quality keeps coming
[Applause]
has certainly picked the right guy to
channel
in raphael nadal
the thing that i'm impressed with so far
in this match is his gives those fist
pumps gets himself all fired up and then
he gets right back to business the focus
is back in the face
very level-headed
[Applause]
so far between aggression and
consistency has been so good
choosing which balls to go after
twice as many winners to enforce
terrorists so far
[Applause]
getting that ball just into the body
just catching it a little bit late
it's in his matches often poss is
the offensive player
he's been playing defense for most of
his match
certainly he's really had their choice
he's not trying to get offensive
[Applause]
ugh oh
[Applause]
is impeccable
makes it look effortless isn't he
so light on his feet
[Applause]
made
[Music]
a bit of a hole here to say the least
down a set down three love
against an opponent who is so far
showing no signs of letting up
completely unfazed it would appear by
his first
performance inside this famous court
tennis has been so good john michael it
feels like i haven't even seen that this
is his first match inside arthur stadium
his first visit to the us open this year
it normally takes
any kind of player a little time to
settle down doesn't it never mind a guy
who's 18 years of age
i'm processing it as well alongside you
here this has just been i think a lot of
people in the stands are
against why so many people have been
talking about
carlos alcaraz for a while
this is what makes makes champions your
ability to go out and
raise the level and keep it
[Applause]
good game so far for pass
big serves
to try his best to start getting a hold
of some of these points the bigger
forehand he's been pinned to that
backhand corner
out
[Applause]
looks going a
still having to play catch up in this
second set
usopen.org that's the official home
official online home for point by point
live scoring highlights real time stats
all the draws the schedule for saturday
will be
appearing soon it's the official
tournament website usopen.org
good point there this is where
mountain attack
team raised his intensity he's not
number three in the world for no reason
he's got all the tools to get back in
matches like this
i'm impressed with the first third
percentage of alcarez so far in this
match
just setting a half in
it's
about 75
it's a good number
certainly for an 18 year old impressive
number
we're not looking at a guy who's seven
feet tall maybe it's easy he's got a
very nice motion
[Applause]
demonstration of the tennis iq
on that occasion the awareness the
clarity
[Applause]
that's a beautiful
offensive backhand top spin lob there
that forehand drop shot so well
disguised
[Applause]
extremely
well where he's hitting the ball
those service boxes
oh
[Applause]
this is an opportunity he hasn't had
many so far
[Applause]
extra intensity in the body language
hmm
[Applause]
the perfect mix
power and spin look at the depth in that
first forehand up the line
watch his footwork to get around this
ball here
all those little steps
ferocious forehand
put it away
juice
a couple good returns up the middle have
worked for sister pass here
alcarez does want to come forward he
wants to be offensive with that for him
he'll play defense if he has to
that's where
jesus boss would like to have him though
a little more defensive
oh
[Applause]
[Music]
being a nuisance in this game number
three sticking around
chance to break back
[Applause]
in his second set
her athletes but three games to two
three two
one
so break a piece now in the second set
[Applause]
balls back in the court
a couple of forehand errors from alcaraz
obviously the missed pass there
at the end good hustle there from
justice but
those four hands that al graz missed he
hasn't been missing so far in this match
as other games
[Applause]
into double figures now for the spaniard
[Applause]
interesting looking at the average
forehand speed of ours
first couple of matches got some numbers
through for my friends at
who's averaging 76 miles an hour first
two match wins
of the week
give you an idea of where that sits
the men's draw shapovalov was leading
the way in 81.
[Applause]
just a couple of numbers three of my
friends or guys up from 76 to 82 today
so oh that's interesting
does it have the top speed
or just the averages
[Applause]
interested also to know how big he's
hitting those winners when he gets set
up how big is that forehand because it's
it's moving on by
awful fast when he gets a hold of those
and those aren't just flat deliveries
there's a good amount of spin on it good
net clearance
of course of course at the open this
year
playing fairly quickly
do you think that would be the result of
a conversation between ours
let's try and just pump it up a little
bit today on a quick court just to try
and rush to pass well i think that's
absolutely how he could gain control and
how he has gained control of a lot of
these rallies i think that's definitely
a conversation they had
it also could be about the excitement of
playing on an arthur ash stadium out
here in front of this crowd it's a big
deal
play this guy out here it's mate
opportunity physical young player
show his stuff
he's certainly showed us a lot so far
you have just spots now digging in
who digs in the best in the world well
it's novak djokovic
but zverev
medvedev not very far behind these guys
know how to get back in matches
how to make it tough on their opponents
and how to play five set matches
as well and get through them
uh
thirty fifteen
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
[Music]
can't be perfect
[Applause]
oh
oh
some serious fear
and a bit 0.2
40 50.
there's also some steel nerves
it's 30 all
they don't pull that out of nowhere
that's the shot he must practice often
and you have to go out in matches and do
it have the confidence to pull it off
impressive
juice
[Music]
[Applause]
that's the right play just didn't quite
get away from it so we could execute on
that inside in forehand
stefano sincipas
starting to truly
push him here
apply that pressure
he does so well
[Applause]
control of some of these rallies
not just play defense force the errors
but truly take control that's a good
sign there
[Applause]
chance to move ahead then
foreign
a moment i was worried for him but there
was no need it was
of the highest quality
[Applause]
just laying that face open for the
dropper
guess what that is not an easy thing to
do off that slice backhand from tissue
pass that's
textbook good right there on the volley
[Applause]
when you're making errors like this lee
it's you know what
he's doing all the right things coming
in on that shot
it's the right move
can't be too unhappy obviously you're
unhappy you miss it but
gotta go with your gut
[Applause]
once more
he's making a lot of new fans today
tell you what he's making me nervous up
here
he's playing you just you watch a guy
like this you just want to see him
continue to play this level
whoever wins this match is just such a
joy to watch it
[Applause]
[Applause]
so that'll be his new fastest server of
the day
it's interesting no aces so far in this
match but
had a good amount of unreturnables
good time for it there just really
mounting an attack in this game
in fact
these last few
oh
second game continues
reduced
significance
this game midway through the second set
[Applause]
when he's trying to go big on it
that's the key he's missed a few of
those shots
it's a very tough thing to do
so
one adjustment that outgrabs can make is
just go a little heavier over the net
and not have to try to hit a winner
there
just go big into the corner
[Music]
[Applause]
three second sets
first set
fascinating contest 4-3
magnificent setting for
[Applause]
an enthralling contest so far
promised much this one
scanning the round of 32 matches through
the us open
so far it's delivered
[Applause]
[Applause]
this is the reaction from the crowd
[Music]
15
[Applause]
certainly turn the momentum around in
his favor he's pretty much wrestled
control of this match back
in the second set
to have a break early
30
15.
[Applause]
[Applause]
right up the middle
again that backhand right up the middle
aggress
just catching it a little bit late
so good at moving to the corners and
around four hands
very high tennis iq he sees there's
opportunities there for him to drive
that ball just
okay
[Applause]
digging in in this second set just a
game away from
leveling this match
[Applause]
[Applause]
lofty
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
pitino
on the first serve actually not great
he's at 38
just six for 16 first serves in
impressive in the second serve
71 there
might like
make you think that maybe a few kick
serves might be a good idea on the first
make it out of the strike zone
13 15.
[Applause]
he's got a good kick on that second lead
uh
more of those in the second section
[Applause]
we did see in the first set stefano
trying to go toe-to-toe with it alcaraz
on those ground strokes coming over more
of the backhands now he's going to that
slice more
and it has drawn some errors
very good
this is supposed to try to hit those
slices
[Applause]
force alcarez to make an adjustment
net height
on those four hints he's trying to
torque
another wonderful strike
to ramp up the game
city best leads
[Applause]
start the third set
ready to go
not worrying about the past
[Applause]
this time the ball right up the middle
paying dividends for alcaraz good
backhand he drove through that one
nicely
uh
that's a decent point from six of
[Applause]
well there you go again just judging
from this match just this match i don't
think that this is going to build out
hit him
coming over those backhands
it's worked very well for him to mix in
the slice
then get four hands and rip the
forehands
slices also brought quite a few unforced
arrows off that topspin forehand valve
grass
[Applause]
that's how he plays tennis
one of the beautiful things about his
game is his ability to adapt though and
change it up
[Applause]
sometimes there's opponents out there
you just can't go toe-to-toe with
[Applause]
looking for a fifth break of surf
let's for service
[Applause]
[Applause]
1840
[Applause]
oh
big forehand there
[Applause]
find that opportunity for this man to
level up five a piece
[Applause]
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
dangerously
[Applause]
didn't catch by much
it's excellent big for him there from
sister boss going on the all-out
offensive
[Applause]
remember he was down three love
and we're in this second set
thank you
that comes
[Applause]
right through the middle
[Applause]
the thing was traveling
[Applause]
advantage six
that is fired up as i've seen stephanos
in one of his matches there's a couple
of
huge raws
young greek
set point as big as the forehands we've
seen from him
[Applause]
in that 10th game
osaka
first of the night matches and then
rublev tiafoe
to finish
seats
quickly please behind the place thank
you
okay
and that's the route that i really do
think favorites
when sushi boss is able to get around
and hit a big forehand that's a little
bit of a different story we've seen that
at the end of the second set
he's able to dictate heavily with that
shot
coming over the backhand has not been
working
fitino
it's about wide
13.
oh
14 15.
that ball just catching the back of the
line
just
a little look at the line but
called good the electronic line calling
system at the open
game
[Applause]
regarding how important these moments
are
[Applause]
first game of the third set then goes
the way the spaniard
to have described the process of
developing enterprises going like a
brick wall every
day as a new brick in the product
the end products that they are
working so hard
towards producing
interesting reading articles with the
fitness coaches about the
physical development as well you tend to
associate it with you with with sort of
building his strength
in terms of what he has to produce on a
court but
very good points about rest and recovery
as well educating a young player
[Applause]
if you're trying to be the very best in
the world all those
fine margins make a difference yeah they
certainly do and
obviously the knowledge base out there
is so much greater than it used to be
players putting a lot of
focus into that all the things that you
can do off the court
to improve your game
oh
[Applause]
thirty
oh
coming forward on those ground strokes
[Applause]
able to flow through the ball so nicely
with his forehand and that one-handed
backhand
oh
okay
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
just a couple of days ago we had that
extreme weather come through the crazy
night of the flooding and all the
the wind and tornadoes
one thing that it did
certainly wash away the humidity that
these players have been
having to play with this entire us open
series leading up to this event and
qualifying first couple days here very
humid but today's weather
well you couldn't ask for a better day
to play some tennis it's beautiful
[Applause]
the sun is warm when it comes out to
some freshness to the earth
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
starting to win
a lot of the longer rallies
i know he's dangerous coming forward
[Music]
oh
that's it
[Applause]
[Applause]
ball right up the middle again
[Applause]
trying the unforced error
[Applause]
it's it's best poised to strike
game three set number
three surprise
[Applause]
it's a good play against a good mover
covers that open port so well
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
confusion
[Applause]
maybe he thought his shot was actually
out
or that it was a double hit on the
the next ball
still struggling to figure out what what
exactly that was
[Applause]
in terms of the fans reaction to city
past today
that's certainly been the case that's
the smallest thing isn't it and they're
on top of them anything
tell you what this the new york crowd
never forgets
[Applause]
a really good hold
that's an important stage of this match
athletes but two games to one
third sets one to two
the conclusion to the previous game he
was looking for citypass after having
the break points challenge fizzled out
that is a significant hold
would have been a significant break we
can be certain on that would have
crushed the momentum
[Music]
that's beautiful wow
both players playing with such urgency
out here
in these rallies
great backhand angle from pass
there to set it all up
just deep
dirty
passage of this match
next to two or three games might
tell us a lot about alkalizes
where he is in terms of the development
in terms of
producing his best against the best in
the best of five set match we haven't
got
too much of an idea of that so far it's
played too many
best of five set matches
and you get to play in this format of
course at the majors
relatively inexperienced in that respect
it's been a significant season
spanning it at the uh the four grand
slams has won a match
in all four of those
making his debut in all four this season
definitely a good sign that he can play
on all the surfaces the way that it hits
the ball
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
walks in the court
of course wimbledon
they're different than the grass of old
that they used to use
sets up a lot more
1413
youngest
player
in the open era
it's one of the four majors it gives you
another indication of
he's achieving at such a young age
okay
two games
stay connected to the us open
on social media facebook twitter
instagram
and youtube you can join the
conversation
hashtag us open
[Applause]
it's funny sometimes my mind filters out
all the squeaking of the feet i'm still
used to watching tennis but when you
actually
zero in on it a little bit listen for
that you see how hard these guys are
working in these points
for that positioning it's ever so
important positioning
on these big ground strokes for both of
them
[Applause]
right ahead for all the
latest information
the final major of the year usopen.org
thirty
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
with his amazing play in that first set
but
stefano is able to gain control of a lot
of these rallies with the big forehand
often looking to get around those balls
now
hmm
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
a little more often for the greek
for the first time
in this contest perhaps we'll feel
it's about sleeping three games to two
that's it once a little more control
degree of comfort perhaps when he looks
up at the scoreboard
with the break
[Applause]
this takes a little bit of a sting out
of the atmosphere as well
across so far the lion's share of the
the crowd support
participants has certainly been
forced to raise the level of his game in
this match
he's up to the task
that's the big ask can alcaraz do the
same
59.
[Applause]
he's been
very solid coming forward
executing well with the net putting the
pressure not staying in those ground
stroke rallies too long
certainly has disrupted the rhythm we
saw from alcaraz in that first set
a lot of the second
[Applause]
i love the simplicity of this two-handed
backhand
from alcaraz good shoulder turn there
open stance
generate pace and then re recover
off this ball
[Applause]
determination
that competitive spirit is such a big
part of 40 30 arsenal
desire to
compete find a way to win
[Applause]
please
[Applause]
looking for a place in the fourth round
for the first time here is the greek
world number three
better and better like qualifying here
2017
lost in the last round to nikko mahu
that occasion second round main draw
2018 lost first round 2019 to rublev
third round last year remember that
thriller with
borna church
got away from six match points was it i
think
memory
that was a crazy match
[Applause]
it's a third round contest
louis armstrong memory serves
just the first double fault
from alcohol so far
has not been a problem for either player
[Applause]
by the way we haven't seen too much from
this year we said shoulder surgery
i'd hoped to come back for the us open
but uh
the ladies return a little longer so we
look forward to bournemouth back on the
match court another great competitor
[Applause]
shoulder surgery back in may was
actually in new york but
went under the knife
[Applause]
borna is getting closer and closer to
being back you see him in the gym and
lightly hitting some balls from time to
time
social media
it's a good sign
that's a good sign right there from
sister boss
forehand is working
[Applause]
let's pass his turn to light it up on
return
gives him a chance of a double break
uh
[Applause]
it is a double break he's in firm
control of this third set
um
[Music]
good under spin
hitting his forehead a little bit bigger
serves look very good as well
[Music]
[Applause]
there's positive reaction here from
carlos alcaraz
stepping into that backhand
fitino
[Applause]
let's second service
13 15.
i do like how positive al karaz seems to
be staying here
[Applause]
two set points
[Applause]
[Applause]
still another set point right here
[Applause]
juice
[Applause]
[Music]
13th forehand winner
advantage
[Applause]
[Applause]
another backhand pass and another one
right up the middle right since he
passed the net
clearly a strategy for alcaraz
not a bad one
does cover that line well
solid mover at the net it's got good
volleys
foreign
[Applause]
good sign from the young competitor here
[Applause]
[Applause]
like five games to three that's it
[Applause]
a racist game there didn't need to get
another break up serve still with work
to do in this third set but
that was impressive
starting to feel like it's a password
just coast through that service game
now christ with other ideas
[Music]
[Applause]
oh
oh
still got great intensity from alcaraz
[Applause]
the backhand he's hitting it a little
bit better in the last few games even
bigger
it's been solid throughout the whole
match but
seems to be dictating more with that
shot
[Applause]
if you're gonna approach against stefano
sissypos you better do it well
defend so well in those corners able to
get the ball down at the feet of his
opponents
last approach out a little bit forced
gives himself further opportunities to
keep this third set going
it does could be fascinating viewing
watching sits past step up to the line
at 5'4
oh
and he's still in business since the
first response by five games to fall
third sets once at all
[Applause]
he tries once more to finish off this
third set
[Applause]
tried and failed at 5-2
let's see if he can do a better job this
time
[Music]
an important first point goes the way
[Applause]
some good depth there from the alcaraz
backhand this pasta defending
and dealing with that very well
let's
second service
pitino
[Applause]
[Applause]
this is a smart play here from outgrowth
trying to force tcpos to hit those
backhands
full of unforced errors there
certainly pressure shots
stats to say they're unforced errors
sensing this could be a big moment
15 30.
oh that's unbelievable
[Applause]
don't let that ball float it didn't
float
that was a great slice
progress had an answer
look at that body control coming forward
that is impressive stuff
once it set to
continue chances for five all
[Applause]
make some noise
i'm very curious to know what
i'll cry thank you
[Applause]
second chance
[Music]
[Applause]
after saving those
two break points
two rallies in a row where he actually
did go toe-to-toe
without there as in the baseline thank
you
ready for play
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
was trying to close it
out a gutsy hold on that occasion from
the greek
fight off another break point
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
the young spaniard back in business
what an incredible effort
[Applause]
this is then he wants now
[Music]
settle fire
[Applause]
jesse pass practicing against toss a
little bit they're still thinking about
the last game be careful you don't
want to get in a hole in your brain
there
forget about it
it's happened
the best of people best players served
for it twice
they'd sort of expect to get through
sets like that but
such a key stage of this match now the
next 10 minutes
[Applause]
doing such a great job of putting balls
back in play off the alcarez serve
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
[Applause]
through the backhand prior to that up
very offensively that last but
kind of tight
it's understandable
it was up 5-2
it's an extremely uncomfortable position
all of a sudden for the world number
three
a massive blow if this set slips away
from him
oh
uh
[Applause]
a lot of flats are in the box doesn't it
say the least
yeah not much facial expression than
those two men
peculiar body language from dad
[Applause]
a little bit more of a chance and hit it
bigger
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
it lined up he knew it was the right
shot just a little bit too flat a little
more neck clearance
hold on slide out there slightly
[Applause]
is
[Applause]
another opportunity
to move ahead
[Applause]
oh
[Music]
oh
[Applause]
surpass the juice by missing the first
serve just to
set up for the return off the second
establish him himself in the point
a lot of pacing going on over there just
boss back and forth back and forth
i want to sit still
[Applause]
eleventh game that's gone back and forth
this right here's one of the reasons
he's number three in the world continues
to fight
even when he's
served for the set twice
a little too down himself opportunity
here huge one
thank you
oh
[Applause]
that's impressive
steel nerves right there
are you kidding me
you really just do that
[Applause]
one of the biggest points of the match
back to juice for a fourth time
[Applause]
it can be difficult against the top spin
these different spins that kisapost can
put on that backhand side
to continue to fight the position look
at how long this game is
[Applause]
uh
[Applause]
rock solid backhand up the line
[Applause]
reduced wow
thank you
oh
[Applause]
advantage significant difference there's
knowing the noise depending on who wins
the point right now
that chant i think was let's go carlos
yeah
simple as that it was first thing they
said it was a hard time but
huge draw
every time this guy wins a point
uh
and a good percentage of this crowd on
its feet so he's dead
by six games to five he's now up to six
five once at all
let's see where this 12th game of this
third set takes us it's about serving to
stay in the set
nice building
on the lights now
[Applause]
stadium lights
into operation at the conclusion of the
last game
dirty
[Applause]
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
gotta be happy doing three straight
points there
[Applause]
that long game
one away first reset breaker
let's for service
oh
14
15.
oh
[Applause]
this great volley however set up by some
nice backhands
[Applause]
really leaning into that two-hander
[Applause]
still sniffing around in this 12th game
it's past with work to do
[Applause]
another ripper right at him
just getting out of the way of it
some impressive hands there
from this boss
have ourselves a third set breaker
[Applause]
[Music]
there we go then a shootout
to settle what has become a fascinating
set of tennis
can't get there
another
[Applause]
further evidence of good decision making
under pressure by the 18 year old
both guys in this set have hit the
forehand so big it's been about for me
at least
who can gain control of these backhand
rallies
[Applause]
2-0
eye contact with coach little mode
[Applause]
just the one mini break
[Applause]
still so impressed with how positive
alcarez stays throughout these his
matches
several ups and downs
still just that intensity in the face
sometimes some disappointment
you don't get any negative
negativity
it does not remind you of
very much his hero rafa
[Applause]
foreign
obviously smaller but it is open
[Applause]
you have the nerves to hit it in the
footwork
to get in position
nice step forward
oh
[Applause]
i just so impressively goes for full
offense
to feel like that
how can you not be excited about
watching this guy
it's a good drop shot and even a better
law
[Applause]
code violation coaching warning mister
i think this is going to be something
[Applause]
please
[Music]
it's for getting spicy
[Applause]
quality of his opponent
the scoreboard right now
he's got a process the fact that
this set was done wasn't it
five two twice he served for the second
amazing set points
on server
like guess what he's got a time
violation
earlier in this match
now warnings
for coaching
his warnings are done
time those things happen it's gonna mean
a lot
just wondering whether if this scent
does slip away from sits
whether he disappears after this set and
what
kind of noise are the crowd going to
make if he does they're not going to
like it if it happens
[Applause]
hit serve
a couple of good points on serve then
and spaniard will
see him up two cents to one
it's a good serve hit his spot
[Applause]
total composure from alcaraz
full set points
[Applause]
and it's the youngster who holds his
nerve the upset is on but has been made
by citypass perhaps in reaction to
the response he's had this week who
knows
fourth set
dizzy
let's focus on the tennis
because it's been wonderful so far
most enjoyable tennis match i've seen in
a while
number three trailing two cents to one
oh goodness for me he's taking a tumble
there
he's okay that's the good news came out
of nowhere didn't it that didn't come
with a little look
just caught the outside edge didn't you
visit
let's during the crossover steps
sometimes shake you up for a couple of
minutes but
hopefully no harm done
judging from carlos's reaction he didn't
seem to phase him he was more
kind of looking around for something
grabbed him
look at it here
in real time
it's pretty athletic fall actually he
got himself nicely
[Applause]
does this crowd want
[Applause]
wow
[Applause]
for the first time today remember he
threw one in
second point of the match alcaraz i
think it was second or third
point i'm not even the biggest fan of
tweeters i
think players do it too often when they
don't really need to hit that shot that
time he had to hit that shot
[Applause]
so far good game though to start that
off this fourth set
purchase poss
got down in the first and second sets
and we back in that second set
3-1
couldn't face the world number three the
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
opening hold of serve
he's gonna have to go the scenic routes
once more though now having
sensationally dropped that third set
five sets it took him to get past andy
murray
it's a lengthy contest
[Applause]
starting to look like it could be
another long one today as well 72
minutes that third set
second set was almost an hour
too far away from three hours on court
so if this does go five
it's gonna be long
good news is uh relatively comfortable
conditions
it's funny we have watched sets of
tennis
72 minutes and they felt like 72 minutes
sometimes
that set went by in a blink
just so on edge
amazing tennis in this match from both
players
[Applause]
so often you you hear about
a player or someone being hyped and so
often for me at least the hype
necessarily doesn't live up to what you
hear but
in this match out here and
pretty much this whole year alcaraz
exceeding it for me
[Applause]
a little bit of a letdown
to be honest understandable
[Applause]
after the high adrenaline stakes of the
third set
[Applause]
really easy to lose the focus
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
and that's exactly the result
was hoping for
this fourth
digit
players boxes oddly seem more relaxed
now after he lost that set they did when
he was in it
we'll switch his racket out
i already had the time violation
remember so it's going to keep an eye on
the shot clock in the night of the match
[Applause]
15
[Applause]
it's actually been a good response
emotionally hasn't it from
given
the drama of that third set
and as fired up as he was getting too he
seems a little bit more calm out here
focused
i've seen pop's playing a lot of
times i usually really enjoy watching
his tennis i haven't seen him that fired
up necessarily in matches
i don't know if it's a response to
how intense alcoraz
alcaraz is on the court
and those fist pumps
[Applause]
clearly being for alcaraz in this match
a couple factors could cause that but he
does definitely seem more focused right
now
[Applause]
so solid from alkaraz
such a compact shot
[Applause]
[Applause]
us
thank you
[Music]
juice
he's turning into
more complicated this game than he would
have wanted
advantage
um
[Applause]
by
from the greek star
approaching golden hour in this part of
the world
just coming up to 10 to 6 local time
it's a beautiful shot
[Applause]
ball right there a little bit tougher
than you might think
truly watch it off of a slice
chip return like that it got a little
bit too low
very important game here for alcaraz
it's gonna up that intensity back up
keep it within one
[Applause]
15 30.
there's that backhand exchange again for
me the
barometer for this match
grass is winning that back in exchange
he's winning a lot of these rallies
getting opportunities to unleash the big
seems to forehand
the opposite just the opposite of the
coin there for tc passes
[Applause]
still relatively inexperienced in this
best five-set format he's just played
one match
in his career that's gone the distance
five sets
[Applause]
[Music]
three in the fifth
[Applause]
challenge has fizzled out a touch
starting this fourth set
already looking like we'll need a
decider outside arthritis stadium
he's come back from two sets two games
down
before just in the last set five two
so these four games have gone very
quickly
by the way the greeks
[Applause]
is for alpharez so far 18 years old
hasn't played that many five five-set
matches
[Applause]
how will he perform against a top player
who has has played plenty
should he go the distance
[Applause]
some of your energy for that inevitable
what looks like fifth set now
just played some intelligent tennis
[Applause]
that's part of it
understanding how much you have left in
the tank
where to employ it really
[Music]
[Applause]
this time around just a game required
[Applause]
it's been some
ticket this one the day session day five
inside arthritis stadium at the 2021 us
open
almost six hours of
high quality tennis the fans have
enjoyed so far this afternoon
special contest between two grand slam
champions
victoria azarenka to kick off the
session that went the distance spaniard
coming through that one
looking like this one's gonna go five
[Applause]
court there
forehand on the first point of this game
is going to be
what alcarez needs to get back to doing
first couple of sets just
crushing that forehand
[Applause]
a lot of points on that shot
to save it all for the
unless he has another amazing
rabbit to pull out of his hat here
what looks to be a fifth set
not you
[Applause]
oh
[Music]
see too many of those in this full set
but
[Applause]
right here to get then he's doing it get
back to playing this way so you can
start at the fifth set
offensively
can't be allowing tissy pass to control
these rallies
that goes especially on his serve
juice
first serve points one in this set
very low 25
it's not a good stat
is waiting for that serve out wide
alcarez has used it very well in this
match
take it away from
some point
[Applause]
in the hunt for a place in the last 16.
[Applause]
[Applause]
a few minutes ago this is just his
second
five set match
best of five set contest that has gone
the distance
it's about certainly with more
experience
in these kinds of contests that have
lasted
five at the majors
it's the only time you play best of five
these days used to be
the davis cup as well but since that
changed
it's gone to best of three won a couple
down in australia
tennessee coconacus in the second round
six four in the 50 beating the dial from
two cents down
[Applause]
in melbourne
first game final set
[Applause]
and then fast forward to roland garros
where of course he made the final that
was his first grand slam
championship match
beats alexander zverev
in five sets there in the semi-finals
6-3 in the fifth loss to djokovic in the
final having
led by two sets
that's my hope here that
whatever is not the issue
that causes this match to go one way or
the other
it's been such a high level match so far
of course barring that maybe that fourth
set
[Applause]
to reestablish some dominance in these
rallies
[Applause]
just passing that fourth set just wiping
the court with alcaraz
[Applause]
this year of course was early this week
which he came through so a good record
in the five setters this season he's won
four out of five
it's a good percentage
keeps his head so level
always knows that his athletic ability
and all the work he does from his
fitness keeps him in it
oh
oh just a little bit
slow getting up to that shorter ball no
of spin there and pace from tissue
[Applause]
good sign here lee hasn't won a game for
a while a chance to
keep it even in the fifth
[Applause]
alright
[Applause]
the legend himself
stan smith
in attendance tonight
[Music]
[Music]
uh
do such a great job in that rally from
going from defense to offense
one of the biggest parts of his game is
be able to do something out of that
corner change direction
keep the ball low use some spin
but we're right back on offense
[Applause]
116 mile an hour delivery just into the
body a little bit
[Applause]
if you can
give them something to cheer
trying to feed off their
energy i might need to over these
closing stages
[Applause]
coming forward
this is what maybe that conserved energy
in the fourth set
payoff for alcaraz
though
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
really paid off for him on some of these
returns throughout this match
oh
oh
[Applause]
certainly sees the court well
[Applause]
this game
early signs for the
spaniards fans pretty good after their
one-sided nature the fourth
[Applause]
it's been quite an occasion this
afternoon
for this young man inside our thrash
stadium
whatever happens a learning process
[Music]
[Applause]
some early stages of game four
fifth set
relatively uncharted territory before
alcor has this
[Music]
[Applause]
raises the roof
[Music]
that's incredible
these left scorch marks on this centre
court after that one
oh
[Applause]
[Applause]
one of the more telegraphed ones from
alcaraz
read it
i do like the fact that alcarez is not
just allowing him to
dig in on the baseline
and defend all day long
don't you
[Applause]
first half chance then
number three poised
14-13
[Applause]
uh
again it's effective
[Applause]
some other things lee about a young
player it's 18 year old here he can do
everything we've seen him hit a serve as
big as 134.
his last serves in the last couple sets
haven't been
near that
for me it's just signs of in the future
how even more dangerous he's going to be
difficult thing difficult 15 prospect of
sustaining the speed of a serve like
that
at that age over the course of five sets
in these long
grand slam weeks
with all the hard work they're doing it
will get there
we've seen the website address pop up
quickly

that's big second serve right there
30
15.
smart placement coming out to the
forehand side if you can hit it well
all right hitting that backhand in the
deuce court
especially in the second serves pretty
well
[Applause]
it's looking a little fresher of the two
at this stage to pass
again
not just ahead again
[Applause]
by three games to two final seasons
three two final set
[Music]
he's done a good job so far in this
deciding set of digging in carlos our
ass the 18 year old from spain
he's got the new balls
hoping
to level the scores once again 2-3
[Applause]
if you could dictate in those forehand
rallies we saw him do it early in this
match
he's coming out bruising that tennis
ball
[Applause]
that's impressive
even juan carlos looks a little bit
tight now
hasn't given us much in this match
for a second
30 50.
nice change of direction there from
posse knows he can't allow alcarez to
dictate from the middle of the court
backhand off the line could be key in
this fifth set
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
service game
a little territory once more
[Applause]
incredible
volley the spaniard produced
this shot right here is just
unbelievable the fact that
is able to track it down
and connect on that lob
breaks up break
points survives
[Applause]
should it stay close
[Applause]
so far
young spaniard that they have been
focusing their energies on
[Applause]
[Music]
so far
[Applause]
let's for service
[Applause]
quickly and deep
[Applause]
see that surf speed 112. it's just
trailed off a little bit
started in the 120s there is a
difference there
oh
[Applause]
this ball here just out of the strike
zone really of to space
stephanos didn't give him a whole lot
didn't need it
okay
[Applause]
a little closer on that occasion to
being broken but another
gutsy hold
continues to stick
like glue to the world number three
15.
[Applause]
big second serve
[Applause]
just start to take some of those second
serves into the forehand side of alcohol
not allowing him to
rip that backhand
[Applause]
in this final set
12 out of 12 first serve points won so
far in this decider by the greek
[Applause]
racing through his service games

fourth show caught port 17 is in the
bottom right hand corner
such a fantastic grandstand facility
and this has been a wonderful spectacle
this afternoon here in new york
hey
[Applause]
just when you start to think maybe
there'll be a little bit of a drop off
you know maybe he's going to start to
feel the pressure trailing again we're
getting into the second half of this
decider
just club's another winner past him we
did see it drop off a bit in that fourth
set
he's definitely
had a little more in the tank it's piers
it's just ridiculous
[Applause]
carlos continues to be composed out
there he having coffee it
the cafe
has said on record that he hasn't been
too surprised by what this guy's
achieved over the last year
to have this completed game
at 18 years old
so impressive
it's crazy isn't it just thinking
young italian but
imagine this guy in six seven years time
scary thought just gonna be scary well
johnny cena just turned 20 as well and
certainly certainly what he's done take
nothing from that
way they compete is very different
oh my goodness you've got to be kidding
me
[Applause]
has given this new york crowd exactly
what they want
[Applause]
this has been fearless
in this eighth game so far
look at that over the course of the
match 15 to 2 on backhand winners
it's about pressing this time
still not done in this eighth game the
greek
40 30
he's experienced enough to know if he
can nick this point get this back to
juice
the pressure will continue to man's
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
he produced in that game
just take your pick where do you want
him to hit the winner from beforehand in
the background
you like better final says
that was incredible 90 miles an hour
that final
strike from the spaniard they've even
got at least one carlos ferraro off his
feet i think he stood up
that's how good it was for a piece
it's getting interesting now three hours
45 on the clock
i mean he's dangerous isn't he
i love that
right up the middle to set up the
forehand he had a good look at that
i like seeing him go big on that could
have just given himself a little bit
more clearance over the net with that
top spin
[Applause]
just feels
starting to feel like he's hitting a
purple patch at just the right time here
if you know and he's riding the wave
of support coming down from these huge
stands
[Music]
[Applause]
has to be fearful here the quality of
tennis in the last couple of minutes
this looks like more of the first set
tennis we saw from alcarez
to a 4-0 lead there
[Applause]
maintains his composure that was a big
point
good stuff
anticipate
i actually feel like i'm riding a roller
coaster here
keep grabbing something to hold on
most of the fans
participating in this match feel the
same way
[Applause]
more intelligent tennis from the world
number three
[Applause]
okay
city fest
[Applause]
4-5
[Applause]
deep into a fifth set
we can control his emotions
[Applause]
way back to try to defend against that
immense pace
[Applause]
as big as he might have at the beginning
of this match we're hitting his spots
well right now
not just getting into the body
of just pasta unable to do anything with
it
[Music]
[Applause]
i'd say pretty
so many signs saying that this guy is
going to be
one day a great champion
thank you
ready for play
now the focus back on to the greek world
number three
[Applause]
this stage
[Applause]
remember a tie break at six a piece if
we get there
let's use the second serving of the
forehand pretty often lately see if
alcaraz will look for it
stick a little good one into the body
[Applause]
oh
don't want to use it too much
that monsters line and weighty
see ya
sends a message doesn't it just it's a
pass
maintain the quality and serve otherwise
that's the treatment it gets
[Applause]
a little bit with that second serve
[Applause]
[Applause]
i mean how big was that fall and up the
line wonderful defense from sits to pass
this time
and gets his nose in front again
[Applause]
[Music]
once more under the spotlight he dealt
with it admirably
and
then we will be into a shootout
i've loved
every minute of watching this guy today
[Music]
for the start of the game beforehand

stamping
[Applause]
uh
[Applause]
direction of this ball

foreign

situation

this season
[Applause]

normally get from the
the line umpires let's take a closer

seemed to know whether that ball was in
or out
nine millimeters long thank you
