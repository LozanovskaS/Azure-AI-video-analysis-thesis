what a start from
curios
[Applause]
love two very very different back end
out there on show
tonight about a th000 RPMs in terms of
spin rate difference between the two
Nicks so flat through the court but a
great redirector of a tennis ball Rafa
though can beat you with that shot on
its own
that'll be an
interesting matchup to watch as the
match continues Rafa's forehand to
Nick's backhand one of the things that I
think has made Nick successful against
Rafa is the fact that he's very compact
on that side and he can actually step up
into Rafa's forehand which bothers so
many people on the backhand side but
Nick has that capability of actually
being able to deal with
it the other benefit for caros tonight
is it's a lot
cooler I think as Fitzy said that's a
little bit of a double-edged sword
because uh the coolness is going to be
nice for him physically but I think it's
going to play into Rafa's game style a
little bit more Rafa is going to like
this cooler condition slowing things
down a little
bit heavier heavier conditions
14 one thing you got to love about
rapper as well as his understanding of
what his opponent's weaknesses are you
look at back at their meetings and you
see how much more he serves into the
forehand of Kos than he does the back
end which might sound a little
counterintuitive to
people but the flatter back end comes
through a little lower
height and he's able to step in a little
easier on
it
403 spattering of Applause on that
double fault
Mr curios is challeng the from the
service line the balls got in well I
think it's a good casing Point here
about the backend return Mark it's more
compact it's it's got a
higher here we go let's have a look it
seemed to have caught the line didn't it
no okay
double okay but he's intent on going to
the forehand on the second ball as well
and there's more Ms of error I think on
curious' back end because
[Applause]
return because it's a small back
swing increases his margin for error on
the forehand he's more likely to make an
error in in Nadal's mind so he's going
there a lot early thank
you please
Advantage
NAD there on the first serve we see Nick
going to the to the block the chip
forehand
return maybe something that he has to
use a little bit more of as he serves to
that side more and more
Nadal could test of Nadal's nerve early
on and his serve but he comes through
first
G and in a nutshell this next game is
going to tell us a lot about where Nick
is in terms of his legs and everything
else being able to get up to his serve
he had a little problem didn't he in his
previous match with his
glue which is where after a a long five
Setter like that you tend to be the most
[Music]
sore well the the great competitors in
this sport can psychologically deal with
ups and downs and the interesting thing
for me will be if Nick goes down a break
in the first set how he reacts
because in the past it seems like he's a
little bit up and down with his
psychology if he's ahead his body seems
to feel good if he gets behind he thinks
of all the the little Nicks he might
have and maybe the heaviness of legs
today
[Applause]
[Applause]
208 strong at the
body average for the tournament 209 for
curios 1
you don't want to be caught in a
negative situation when you're at the
net and Nadal has time this is uh long
odds to win the point from that
position vs
Ultra aggressive on the forehead early
well miss there but that's where life
Rafa likes to get the ball from once he
finds that inside out forehand he can be
devastating from that
position Rafa's wife
Maria let's
[Music]
G it's been interesting from both when
you look at their serving patterns you
see n go into the back end on the first
point of the first game there and yet
traditionally he's been going into the
for end to try and I think keep Kos
onest Nick if you've watched him play
against Rafa goes te pretty much on both
sides more often than and he went out
wide a couple of times probably trying
to shift Nadal a bit out wide for that
serve his favorite one a bit of a worry
even well it's an indication of how good
curiosity's first serve is because
you've got a returner of Nadal's
magnitude guessing on the first serve
there
interesting
15 Nick looking backand there
well he guessed as well didn't he on the
Nadal so that's also interesting you
know you don't see Nadal though moving
one way before a first serve too often
he normally has both angles
covered how pumped up is rapper when you
see his body language normally it's
aggressive but tonight it it just
seems even more so look at that leg
strength and the preparation
he's looking like a cat
early well done
there also interesting Fitzy to see his
pacing between the points he is looking
like a cat in a cage with some raw meat
just outside
the F for hand from Kos nalo just
caressing one into the space that have
been created
at these two already in the opening
three games have created a great
atmosphere here 2-1 and he's hit the
ball very dynamically he's not just
putting the ball in the court and trying
to extend the rallies he's trying to
make Kos work hard left and
right
good that shot alone can keep Rafa off
balance though and that's what Nick's
hoping
for if he serves well if he's got a high
percentage of first serves he's serving
with that kind of accuracy it's going to
make it tough for
him oh what a
[Applause]
forand well nothing wrong with with the
Curious approach was that he hammer that
forand out wide and
Nadal right now you think he's going to
win the
point that's about as good as it
gets very clean in this last match
against Karina Buster of course uh his
fellow Spaniard does not bring to the
court the same kind of
serve that curios
does 13
[Applause]
14 serving extremely well right now
finding the first serve good locations
spread spreading it around in the
[Music]
Box 43
it's a little bit of Tin Cup right there
missed it the first time I'm going to go
back to it sure I can make that
shot a little bit ill advised probably
both times
advantage fous
[Music]
[Applause]
juice right now it looks like without
reading any stats or knowing the numbers
it looks dangerous when Nadal gets the
serve back to me for
curios yes he's serving well getting a
lot of free
points but G when the ball's back in
play Nadal the
fite he needs those free
points and that's going to be one of the
subplots we look at how long can he
continue to serve at the level that he's
serving at right now which has gotten
him out of
trouble still early Rafa is going to get
a better feel for the
return big Point here Brad isn't it
first break point Nadal early in the
first 50% of his first serves in this
tournament haven't come
back and that one was a crucial one for
Kiros shail that didn't come back over
his side terrific serve
[Applause]
Advantage good second serve opened the
court enormously there interesting that
he went to a backhand from that position
actually kind of ran around his forehand
to take a backhand there
Rafa another look at a break point
on so smart from
Nadal didn't Panic on a that forehand
just lofted it high to the two-hander he
knew that Kos couldn't generate enough
Pace from up there off that
two-hander and instantly Nick Kos having
a crack at his box
never think that's a good sign I don't
care who the player is I just think it's
a bad
sign you have to take responsibility for
that he was not sure whether it was the
tension of the racket but gee a big
statement from Nadal early for
me he's competed hard for 70 minutes so
far
curios needs to maintain that for four
hours here
that
that is Picture
Perfect beautifully constructed point
from the Spaniard the problem Kos has in
the back of the court is more than it's
it's it's twofold threefold but the big
one for me is
that he's he played a good point there
he he kept the ball in he hit it with
speed competed hard still loses the
points
you play that point about as well as you
play almost without hitting a cold
winner yeah it's the winner off the
backhand side says something as well
under appreciated at times Rafa's
backand he can create some angle off
that he likes to step in on that side
and get on the front
side great return there from K
curios took that early cut the angle off
what do you reckon the percentage
chances of him saying a backhand return
at 30
although low very very
low that's just Rafa sticking one in the
bank there to keep him honest for
later let for service
he
that's Nick getting the better of that
rally but Rafa still looking for offense
off that
forehand the crowd definitely creates
energy for Nick it's 30 all in this game
it's still a massive Advantage for
Rafa foran return coming is way and the
slice has gone completely out of feder's
repertoire on the return against Nadal
and you kind of feel that if he's going
to block the forand back he's going to
be in trouble he's better off swinging
hoping that he connects with a few
G Nadal another test another one
overcome for Nadal as he has so many in
his career 4-1 first set leads by four
games to
one he's five and one at Grand Slams the
only person he's lost to of course Rafer
at Wimbledon
but he's looking a little bit behind the
eight ball early here Lefty when you
talk about his leftin I thought that
last service game he really used his
leftin to massive Advantage there
sliding the serve on the de side into
Nick he was able unable to clear a
little bit of space there
it's and then again going to the
backhand side on the last point of that
game mixing him up changing things a
little bit just keeping him off balance
the te team
[Applause]
[Music]
14 well he's going to have some games
like this curios where he serve is
unplayable that's just the way it is
it's one of the the best first serves
we've seen in a long
time and Rafa has made a couple of
unforced airs in this
game when he gets the ball back ra
43 he he looks like he's going to win
virtually every point from the back of
the court and that's that can be telling
that means Nick's serve has to be
outrageously good
game
cuos which of course it can
be one of the other subplots for me
talking about Nick serve is to see where
he's going to be with his second serve
he went through a period of time where
he was hitting second serves well over
200ks on a regular basis so far tonight
we've seen him at a more normal pace for
most guys but he's a bit of a gunslinger
and when he gets to that second serve
and it's on a big Point sometimes he'll
just try and go for it I think you'll
see it more and more if he doesn't win
too many points at the back of the Court
parade won't you you'll have to take the
risk with the second Ser
more LS for service
[Applause]
15 great disguise there from Rafa you
see this Nick got a little bit of a late
start moving to that ball still got
there definitely testing the legs
wow that's impressive though isn't it
he's Ultra aggressive and Brad you
picked it up early you could see it I
think by the backand wing when he goes
hard at that back Wing you know
everything else is going to be hard and
fast too for sure geez hitting the ball
with a lot of forward
speed Ultra aggressive
and the serve setting it up isn't it we
think of Rafa as for a clay quarter a
baseliner wants to play long points but
if you look at the stats he dominates
serving one serving two so much so many
of his points in matches are played just
like that
game you sp part two lead a hold to love
and he'll be loving
it capacity crowd as you would expect
for this contest between these two uh
competitors best forehand you've ever
seen
Brad it's the unique
beforehand it's uh it's one of the best
without a doubt different swing
mechanics sometimes I'm not a fan of the
the swing that goes over the head I
think a lot of people get fooled by the
fact that even when it does go over the
head the racket goes out and through the
ball a lot 100% before he follows
through up and so it creates kind of a
false impression of of where he's
contacting the ball but the force and
the rotation that he generates off the
ball is
astounding when he was younger I used to
think that the arm was just going to
come off at the shoulder some point
but there's always a banquet of
consequences when Nick steps between the
lines on a tennis court this is his
Battle Ground of Hope tonight and at the
moment it feels more hope than
expectation with the way that Rafa has
started he looks ruthless
Relentless and cuos is going to have to
find a bit of magic you feel to keep the
Spaniard at Bay serving a stay in this
opening set
curios coming in 53% of his second Ser
points one
tonight so far
29 might need to dwell and think about
that for a second that's significant
isn't it
I mean it's early days really we we've
played seven
games uh that stat makes you stop and
think that's all about Nadal being too
strong from the back of the Court by a
long way so far in this
set that just doesn't work that often
against so that needs to be a sparing
tactic or you got to hit it almost SL to
get yourself tired to net because he can
see you
coming yeah that distance you think that
you've got an advantage to come forward
off of that but that distance creates an
opportunity for him to see that you're
coming forward and it's really easy from
that position for him to dip the ball in
front of
you tou you
the First Serve by far the most
important weapon that Nick has pulled
out in this
set but in this set R he has to win by
the serve that he hasn't found out
another way has he and uh you got to
give him credit he's hung in there with
the first serve it's kept him here
within Striking Distance not he's still
down a break but at least it's got he's
got a chance
oh he won't believe he's missed
that now leads by five games to
[Applause]
three and he wasn't even giving him the
head fake was he he just miss
it didn't need to be that good at
all I love Rafa's reaction there not so
much his facial expression as we see
here but the fact that he just
immediately turns his
back back to
business first couple of points here are
important serving for the first set you
put this in the bag if you're raer your
percent his chance of winning this whole
match goes up significantly
[Applause]
15 showing his capabilities flatter that
time than most of the other serves that
had gone to the beforehand
incredible amount of wind just suddenly
picking up
here bearing the serve well isn't he
into the body there is hurting curios
both in the for
the right hip and and also the left hip
on the backhand side of curos as well
jamming
him it's just not giving him any width
so you can't pull him off the court off
the return use that two-hander and he's
just narrowing his own Baseline that he
has to stand
in and again 30 love po one down the
middle there just to keep him honest
which he's not going to use when it
really matters which he didn't when it
that game got back to 30 o
[Music]
oh Nick making an adjustment on the
return he's trying to think his way
through some of these points but it has
a big problem here tonight Raa has a
safe Zone into that back end he gives
him no Pace rather than pace and Nick
just can't hurt him and if he takes it
back Cross Court he's in all sorts of
trouble efficient opening set here from
the world number one three set
points has the game Kos getting further
and further away behind his Baseline and
he drops behind by the set
[Applause]
love
team taking the extra RIS risk on the
second serve we've talked about
[Music]
it the harder he finds it to win from
the back of the Court the more that
should logically
happen out
oh
that is
magnificent you can only have utter
admiration for Nadal when he steps onto
a tennis
call Nick able to control this point
early on was playing offense in the
first three or four shots but Rafa as he
often does changing the complexion of
that point
15
14 massive elevation on the ball from
theal tonight off that forehand side as
well he's just getting it high as he can
up there
just goding curios into trying to rip
that back
and and the errors are
coming don't underestimate how big that
point was and this one
[Applause]
is he will not want to be down a break
early in the second against the way
Rafer is
rampaging he's missed three serves down
the te on the outside
[Music]
unbelievable
exchange well juice let's let's forget
about the one between the legs here cuz
this is taking a big risk from curios he
right now he looks like he's not the
favorite to win the point but for the
first time for me raford didn't get stay
on the front foot and go really
aggressively he played a tiny bit
passively and finally cuos was the one
that used his forehand
[Music]
was brilliant from rappa I'm not
entirely sure what curios is thinking
he's going to achieve with just floating
the ball up high
Brad He's just searching for answers
right now
not sure exactly what he needs to
[Applause]
do Rua's movement to that forehand was
absolutely
[Applause]
phenomenal is he telling them to stand
up in the Box what is it cuz they all
were they were jumping up
well that's one of his favorite plays
against Rafa that plus one drop shot and
he created the space by finally finding
a first
serve and this opening game of the
second set is taking on huge
significance
[Applause]
nickel be happy with that freebie there
I think Rafa from his standpoint even if
he loses this game right now he'll be
happy with with this game in general
it's like he's throwing body shots at
Nick and this is going to take a toll as
the set goes on
[Music]
[Music]
his appetite for the fight is just all
consuming voracious isn't it it
is you know to curios his credit here
he's fighting hard from the back of the
cour and winning half the points in this
game from the back how long can he do
that
for he has to serve at that 7 five odd
percent you'd
think not sure about the drop shot from
rapper whether he needs to use it Mar I
mean he he's the out andout favorite
every time he gets the serve back as
well as curios is playing for the back
of the Court here I'm not sure why you
complicate things maybe he thought he
was just so deep and he wanted to mix it
[Applause]
up but it seems the percentages are so
much with him if he just plays a regular
backourt point
[Music]
jez the thing that's impressive to me
here is we see this so often from the
top players Rafa just unwilling to give
in in this game he's going to stay out
here for as long as it takes to try and
get this break and again he knows he's
making Nick
Work fitness trainer in the glasses
standing up trying to give him some uh
support there
advantage
curios that was an extremely well
executed drop shot that time Rafa still
getting there
but this one put him in a tough position
[Applause]
Kos going to try and come in here as he
looks like he's crowding the Baseline a
little
bit Contin
jeez hitting that backend well tonight
isn't he I mean the winners and the
heaviness creating angle doing
everything right on that
Wing it's not always the case but it
is relatively frequent by Nadal
standards
[Music]
correction he'll be just that that his
backhand actually can be quicker than
his forehand out here if he needs it to
be where about further up no fur up up
this way no no no further up this way
this way I
just Mr curious is challenging the call
right near line the ball scored
in but he's desate desperate for points
against the serve
wow well I don't think I'm not sure
about you guys I I expected that to be
in cuz I it just looked like it and uh
Nick wasn't sure didn't even know where
the ball had landed so bit of a break
for him Raa hit it so I expected it to
be
in
1 you just have to love the
response just comes back drops an ace
think psychologic raer would have been
pretty disappointed there to get that
call if it was touching the line so they
would have had to replay the
point so he just blocks it out gets on
with the
business we talk a lot about trying to
find the t's backand off the Ser you
feel as though you're going to get a
little bit more chance because when he
has the forand play Not only is it a bit
quicker than his back end but he spreads
the play you watch his tennis and you'll
see him spread the play with his
forehand open space back behind the
opponent his backhand 85% of the time
he'll go crosscourt with his plus one
shot but trying to find that back end to
get a jump on him G the it's definitely
easier said than done what's serving in
that game from the D and again look at
that 405 a bit of space between the two
of them drops one down the T So Brad
your point now in the previous game when
curios had to work so hard we'll be I
think it's telling right now he has to
start again and do the same thing at the
same
level to hold
again and time and time again that's the
mental effort you're talking about yeah
just just starts to drain you after a
period of time fighting through every
service game Nick will be hoping that he
can drop some bombs here and get through
an easy game
15 l a good change up off the first
serve I like that play off the first
serve I don't like it much off the
second serve
[Applause]
[Applause]
31
149 and this is just what the doctor
ordered for Nick
let's presice
calm as you like from
theal not often I see a fellow
commentator start applauding in the Box
M you were way better than me I I
appreciate that shot that was a great
shot the thing I think about from a
point like that is that
despite the 40 love lead rafo will
continue to make him work he's going to
try and get this back to Deuce he's not
going to give in
here well he's got away with that a
number of times that plus one drop shot
we were looking for it he's introduced
it more in this second set and had
considerable success curios 21
the party bunker what are we going to
we're going to have to find something
for it
well you got to give it to Kos here
early in the second he's hung in there
looked like he was hanging in by thread
actually in the first game but he's got
aead 2-1 and he's competing here
[Music]
15 on Rafa really pushing the time clock
there toss the ball up with one second
left on the time
clock almost be surprised if he didn't
get a Time violation at some point
okay the first inch of daylight for Nick
curios now 15 we haven't seen Rafa miss
an easy one like
[Applause]
that sometimes you need some help from
the other guy couple of unforced airs in
this game
[Music]
but you got admit Nick Kos played a
pretty amazing point there he kept the
ball in he hasn't made any errors here
this
game did everything he could to put
pressure on the D but it was just a
heavy hitting and there's the back end
that opens up the
court and that's not an easy forehand
for most Mortals down the line over the
high part of the net under a bit of
pressure
1530 T what a point
somebody just before madal hit that
serve said come
on from the crowd and I think James got
the one's going to have to say something
here and Nick wisely using the crowd to
his
Advantage knows the crowd's behind him
here thank
you
please bright point for the Australian
[Applause]
need
he's made
it on the right Baseline and the
Australian fans
erupt in celebration what a breakthrough
for cuos
[Applause]
[Music]
well I'll tell you four games ago I
didn't really see that happening he's
competed well hasn't he to really make a
mini turnaround here and a significant
one he really dug
deep this games Rafa gave him a couple
of free points during this game which
opened the door but the points that they
did contest Nick just refused to make an
error
[Applause]
[Music]
one of the many paradoxes about ni
curios is that he's turned an art
form of serving big but not returning
well into massive entertainment for fans
around the world I mean his numbers
compare in with the likes of Riley
oelker and John isno when people talk
about how their games are seen
he wins just 133% of his return games
and he's right down there with the likes
of is and a but where he is different is
when he has a break point he's exactly
the same in terms of converting as Nadal
isnar and opela are way down the chart
they're at like 28% curios turns it
on it's kind of part of his charm and
trying to out Bluff him there with the
underarm serve as well
[Applause]
yep what a
turnaround curi to the charismatic
Australian up 41 in the
second she's got to cut down on
those I don't think he needs to do
anything different he he's been playing
so well hasn't he BR I mean it's just
the that he missed a couple in at The
crucial times the 15501
hurt and curios came out with a couple
of amazing shots too but he looks so
good tonight to me Nadal yes he finds
himself down 41 in the second set
but 30 L curios has had to play an
amazing standard to get to this level to
get to this score line so if you in the
D's Camp you just say hey buddy just
keep doing what you do best
40 low
[Applause]
the K show suddenly in full flow
mhm game what a recovery and that was
from Nadal and you can see why he stayed
away from the two-hander the angle that
curios can create but Nadal quick enough
to catch up to it by four games to when
cuos gets down and his opponent serve he
does what he did there at 40 LA or
something similar he gives away games
very quickly sometimes he's not prepared
to come back from 40 love too often
unless he wins the points with a couple
of screaming winners unlike Nadal who
will fight and scrap and make you work
until you
finalize that service
game impressive feel right there that's
the one we talked about earlier Rafa
getting that down at his feet but Nick
up to the task on the half volley
[Applause]
this incredible
fail he's lifted his game playing some
amazing tennis right
[Applause]
now definitely feeding off the energy
can feel the buzz
[Applause]
35 little bit of a momentum shifter that
double
Nick will change that if he can drop a
bomb again right
here 14
[Applause]
there's been a abundance of riches on
display tonight by both
players C to serve at his Immaculate
best right now game away from leveling
up this
match games to
15 love
so don't be surprised to see him drop
these next two points quickly that's a
tendency for cuos I don't always agree
with it
but he'll be focusing on that first
point on his service
game possibly
40 love yeah I think you're absolutely
right fit he has a tendency which from a
spectating point of view or from a
coaching point of view is frustrating at
times to just let these kind of games go
with the that I'm going to hold
surf it's not an ad DNA is
it something something Rafa definitely
can't
comprehend G it
off one things for sure you knew is
going to give himself another chance to
break the curios serve and keep this
games
to I'm sure even if he loses this game
he wants to serve first in the third as
well he would see that as an
advantage but he's going to throw
everything he possibly has at this
opportunity to
break that's a small factor I agree with
you Fitz but so important for players to
force their opponent to serve for the
sets toughest game to serve out always
players feel the most pressure trying to
close sets or matches
out first point or two here thank you
really big in the context of this whole
match what a stroke falling away a
little bit off the back foot here
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
you're going to have to earn it 15 all
[Applause]
oh
how going impressed with his consistency
from the back of the Court actually
raford is missing a few Now isn't he in
a longer
rally yeah that's that's definitely
changed to some degree
[Applause]
and especially given the score line
there bit of a surprising error from
ra he's been going to that slice down
the line a lot they're choosing to come
over
[Applause]
how quickly did you read that short
ball got you
all yeah he is like a big cat here just
soon as he gets a short ball straight in
he
goes saw it early and his movement to
that ball was really good it's been
interesting on this due side the last
Point both first and second serves when
the doll made his split step he went a
little bit left to his forehand side
side and again
there looking for the
team credit to Nick there he's changed
up his strategy as well because that is
his tendency to go big down the te on
those
[Applause]
points set point
and again he sends theal the wrong way
six G set a piece here and Nick is
leading his army of
[Applause]
[Applause]
Believers back to
eal and a very smart end into that
service game there and again it just
lets you into Nicks World there is a lot
of intelligence and there is a lot that
go of thought that goes into his
tennis tries to Bluff it at times but
yeah those are some great
numbers 15 winners versus seven unforced
airs but one of the biggest things that
stands out to me is seven of seven net
points
one and the serving still over 70%
[Applause]
those types of shots just kept Nadal a
little bit more off balance didn't they
but I bet he would love to have
that one forand back at 3040 in that
opening game of the second set be a
little bit more aggressive with it as we
see the break point where things
dramatically changed
[Applause]
around time
[Music]
never afraid to be different never
afraid to be the rebel the Maverick out
there on the court in the press
conference and he may well be the
ultimate disruptor as well of course
Nadal seeking his second Australian Open
title and that would make him the only
man in the open era to have won all four
majors twice
[Music]
[Applause]
world this is exactly what everybody
wanted a hugely competitive match and
we've got
one 15 and I think the questions that we
asked early on about Nick's recovery
from that long five
Setter he's given us an answer not the
one we necessarily
expected 30 love Rafa going hard body
with the Lefty slice that ball just
breaks into your
forehand Nick completely caught off
guard there
there
40
lovegive as a courtesy to both plays
please keep the adverse comments to
yourself thank you a good call from
James kabong that look he's remained
aggressive the whole match has Rafa he
just made a few errors at the wrong time
in the second set and that coupled with
the competitiveness of curios was the
difference but no need to change that
strategy and he certainly hasn't in the
first two points here
game
Nadal yeah we know how good a front
runner Nadal is in terms of first game
grabbing the opening set in the course
of his
career just looking at Nick's numbers in
terms of how many matches he's turned
around when he's dropped the opening set
he's 21 and 54 which actually isn't the
worst number although currently he's uh
lost 13 out of his last 14 matches when
he's dropped the opening say he on a run
of nine straight and of course Nick
being Nick the one person he did be in
that particular sequence
was Rafa exactly aapco saving three
match
[Music]
points he brings a a different mentality
a different energy to these kind of
matches when he gets to play these guys
he likes it it's interesting if you look
at the draw in aapco he played a lot of
good players there that were ranked
ahead of
him where he sometimes struggles is when
he plays the guys that he actually
doesn't respect as much drops a first
set against them and just loses interest
almost
[Applause]
see not enough on the
approach love that not enough and Rafa
read it watch Rafa's movement here he
knew where he was going he read where he
was
going was there early to make the pass
Carlos moer doesn't often do that too
often a set all with Rafa playing out
there having won the opening set he's
just a little
uncomfortable oh that's an amazing shot
gee he's in form though is he's hitting
some incredible shots here Nick
15 in the first
set when Rafa got the ball back into
play he was winning almost all of
them but now the shot making is coming
to the four a little bit as the match is
war worn on
got you
[Applause]
[Music]
all five and five on first serves in
this game
43 continuing to
maintain his
consistency that's a testament to what
we were talking about before in his his
service motion his
action game car
one game
[Applause]
on well the big three may be better
tennis players simply than the rest of
the next gen coming through as Alexander
Z said coming into this year's
Australian Open but if you can't touch
the ball effectively you can't make
great things happen and curios has done
a good job there of taking the racket
out on a D's hand
all
great core positioning from ladal to
take advantage of that last shot because
C is undoubtedly trying to softball him
consistently here
great finish there from Rafa but
impressed again with
Nick 21 shots in that
rally Focus concentration unwilling to
give away a point right there
dir love
[Music]
oh
[Applause]
the well done
boios the forehand line doing the damage
here gets him this short
[Applause]
ball I think Nick's
underappreciated for his tactical
abilities recognizing what makes an
opponent uncomfortable what he can do to
take advantage of
them yeah he comes up with the
unexpected doesn't he and changes the
complex of of the of the competitive
nature of the of the game I think he's
has these little things he throws in
that it can have an effect on the
opposition
game good game there though RAF is still
focused Nadal leads by two games to
[Music]
one it's been a little fidgety tonight
at the change events looking as so he's
getting his uh energy gel out there he's
in for the Long Haul there's no question
[Music]
that he's going to be looking to do that
as much as possible the lag on the for
and the break in the wrist where he gets
the racket head acceleration from and
that was the one where he just span
round
time back out to Federation
Square back out to Federation Square she
spent a little bit of a my morning there
the other day watching the tennis on the
big screen it's a lovely place to spend
just over the road from flender Street
Station and then you can hop yourself
down here to the rod La Arena where of
course we have been watching this
magnificent match unfold as we see
another gorgeous sunset in Melbourne
seats quickly please thank
you all calm there not so calm here
plenty of intensity plenty of
intangibles
[Music]
15 well raer won't be happy with that
Miss will he great opportunity there to
get to love 15 yeah not at all he did a
great job of of directing traffic with
his shots and creating the opening that
he wanted and then wasn't able to
execute that'll be a bad error in his
mind he does have lofty expectations
though well deserved
15 on
[Applause]
1 again I like that play a lot on the DU
side off the first
serve at that sort of pace as well where
it gives him a little more chance to get
in yeah he was going to be right on top
of the net for that
[Music]
Bing sometimes the quicker you serve it
out there the less time you get to get
in and Nadal can use that pace back but
it's
fascinating to watch how much Nadal is
still currently
guessing and missing y
14 he's forced his way into the contest
here hasn't he this is impressive
competitive tennis from curios you don't
always see it from him but this is uh
for me a significant last 45 minutes
he's he's in this match now
he's G in his M's head a little bit
hasn't it he's right there in his
Consciousness and
Nadal certainly dropped off that for we
saw in the opening set where he was
virtually
[Applause]
Flawless Nick with the constant chatter
to himself from a psychological
standpoint the only time you're worried
about that is if he starts answering
himself I guess it depends whether he
thinks he's got all the
answers let's for service if he starts
using different voices and one is asking
the question and one is
answering something split about that I
think that's a sign of schizophrenia
great play there from Rafa I think all
tennis players are slightly
schizophrenic hey don't look at me Brad
what what there's always a couple of
personalities out there you're dealing
with you remember when Goran said the
good Goran came today not the bad Goran
[Music]
there's always seemingly an exception to
the rule though as we've seen Nick's
brother Rafa he doesn't seem to have
that kind of split personality it's just
one
way and there has certainly been success
in that simplicity
40 love I think Rafa like the best just
doesn't show his opponents
anything or you could look at it the
other way and say that he shows them a
lot and it's always that he's there for
the fight
well the wizard against the
magician and take your pick who came out
on
top down leads by three games to two
it's amazing what you can find on
Google first point so big I think for
both these players when they're
serving you get behind and your heart
rate really goes
up set all three
all anybody's match right now
he
Mr Nadal is challenging a call on the
left Far Side line the balls got out
tough to see from where we
were Nick was actually covering the
bounce felt
wide certainly worth the challenge I
just wonder whether Nal was challenging
to py a little extra time
15 another lengthed exchange another one
one by
[Applause]
curios you won the majority of long
rallies in the second set seven to four
against Nadal somewhat surprising
unbelievable effort from Nick Kos I
don't think I've seen curios moved this
well his anticipation and movement here
to stay with Nadal and the heaviness of
shot is quite
extraordinary
1 I mean imagine if he'd made that
that's what I was thinking the crowd
went crazy just based on the quality of
the point but had Nick been able to pull
off that volley the energy in here would
have gone through the roof
well curios is making Nadal go to
another level
here 4
[Applause]
absolutely great
pass game NAD yeah this is a beautiful
contest between these
two the cut and thrust of tennis at its
very best 4-3 Nadal third
new
balls and as close as it
feels and as exciting as it is I still
feel as though Rafa is a heavy favorite
to come out on top of this just the way
things are unfolding here hour 50
minutes this set's going to be probably
push it past the 2hour mark he looks
fresh at the moment you just keep
wondering can he keep going he watch
I'll play these points and he thinks
yourself it's their logic in his mind
that if I keep playing the the way that
I am that that's what's going to end up
winning me the
match I'm not sure yeah it's it's an
unknown isn't it really Mark I mean he
continues to be an enigma Nick Kos I
mean I thought after his 4H hour 20
minute match two two nights ago he would
be sluggish here but he's moving as well
tonight I think as I've ever seen him
[Music]
the only time these two players have
been in slow motion or static is when we
shown it on 4D and there is cuos
collapsed on the
[Music]
ground and although he was just a little
frayed around the edges when he started
this match perhaps just through the
pressure of the occasion he has calmed
himself down and in doing
so has ignited the passions of this
Australian
[Applause]
crowd this is why you buy a ticket for
Grand Slam
[Music]
Tennis 15 love
[Applause]
he went for
it we weren't going to go through the
whole evening without seeing it
once I'm just not sure though whether
that was the right time
15
all well those are the questions that
curios creates for
everyone we saw the other night him
going between the legs on a absolutely
massive point that he ended up losing
and could have cost him so much saw it
again tonight
yeah and they could cost him they could
absolutely
C he's thrown just a little gasoline on
the Nadal Fire by doing it as well yeah
he didn't need to change anything did he
he hadal's
respect he may well get Nadal's
vengeance
Rafa wishes he had another look at that
he read it he knew where Nick was
going obviously not an easy shot from
there
[Applause]
but I think he believes he should have
made it there was a lot of court to hit
into there
he's made some questionable strategic
decisions in this game yeah again I
mentioned it earlier I don't like that
play on the second
serve it's funny though as you said Mark
that was a much slower serve it get him
a lot of time to close but he he didn't
really get in on it and he didn't pump
the volley either tried to take Pace off
it Miss hit it
slightly patience is an action and
adal's been patient waiting for his
chance
well juice enigmatic tennis
continues is there anyone in the stadium
thought he was going to hit that shot
not not not here but that's what makes
it a great shot yeah the
unpredictability as a player being
unpredictable is a good thing as long as
you're
executing ah High forehand in the middle
of the
[Music]
Court as complicated as he's made this
game he uncomplicates things with a 218
down the te on the
line nobody has a response to that
well that was an adventure for gim big
moment for me I mean he he put a little
bit of anger in the tank of Nadal as you
said Mark he did he didn't need to do it
but he with he withstood the the anger
[Music]
[Music]
well
love pet you said that you still felt
Nadal
is the
favorite is it
turning I feel it yeah I think you feel
it Fitz I do petch isn't a Believer
[Music]
yet CL fall he he had to make that 15
all
the thing for me with Kos is that
despite the fact that he hasn't been to
a final or won a grand slam is that you
just sense that he's capable of closing
these kind of matches out he's not going
to be afraid if he gets an opportunity
13 he's still playing toughest
competitor in our
[Applause]
game yeah there's a long way to go to
beat Rafael nadell isn't there from here
exactly
[Applause]
sometimes I
think curios doesn't give the crowd
their money's worth enough tonight
they're getting
it in Spades
[Applause]
yeah there's three pretty big smiles in
this commentary box we're loving this
this is good stuff
yeah he's made
that
[Applause]
403 if Rafa was a superhero I think he'd
have laser beams coming out of his
[Applause]
eyes let's for service
[Music]
juice you kind of feel Nadal needs to
occasionally go back
behind curios a few more times off that
ad return he's going inside to the space
and cuos is reading
it and the forehand has faltered a few
times tonight in some crucial moments
[Music]
Advantage
NAD curios did an amazing job to open
the court there backed off on the return
didn't he got what he wanted off this
[Music]
ball short and low just hard to get it
up and down from there yeah that's n out
of 10 in terms
of difficulty Factor isn't it certainly
eight he's seeing the ball like a
football here curious his timing right
now
is good as I've seen I think from him
and we talked about early how Nadal was
targeting the forehand
there again on that point went right
there but so compact squared that right
in the center of the racket so clean off
the
[Music]
return thank you
there's not an inch of this court that
these two haven't
touched the width on display tonight the
creativity from the back of the court
has been
mesmerizing and all Nadal can do at the
moment is try and weather this storm
yeah I hav haven't seen better tennis
than this at this year's Australian Open
that's for
sure score the environment just creating
drawing the best from each other right
now just wiping his hand
down this is hard work being invested
here by the world number one can he keep
curious at
Bay tremendous game from both players
everything that's great about this sport
on display 54 third
games love
[Applause]
J just the third double by the
Australian
[Applause]
15 again there's the intelligence from
curios he's had great success with the
inside out forand but he's pulled that
one inside in and adult although didn't
go completely for the Inside Out was
just late getting back
[Music]
15
Duty it's going to have to settle
himself here yeah this is the first time
we've seen him in a while now just a
little bit out of
sorts open with that double
fault loose air on that ball
thing is he has this cannon that he can
erase it with with one
shot he's still favorite from 1530 I
mean comforable favorite I think at
[Applause]
[Music]
1530 still serving at 75% for serves in
this set
403
[Applause]
he looks to be on a mission here doesn't
he but this third set f is telling no
matter what context you look at it in
here Rafa wins this set the whole thing
could turn on its head he might win the
fourth easily if Nick wins it
he probably becomes favorite does
he I think they both understand and
recognize the significance of this third
set two sets to one lead either way is
going to be enormous for the player who
can close this set out
[Applause]
oh my goodness every point so valuable
and that one going nal's way in the end
but boy wasn't he
fortunate fortunate and skilled well
done on this volley right here
[Applause]
well I'm not sure that wasn't an out
ball well what I noticed there is what
Mark talked to earlier that Rafa is
continuously right now playing to the
open court and Nick broke so early for
this ball
[Applause]
and then just went for a little bit of a
slap shot Rafa just couldn't control but
I think Mark said it a while back and
it's he he continues to play open court
tennis go behind him
more come
on that forarm was reminiscent of the
one in wasn't it which Rafa wasn't happy
about
[Applause]
I'm not sure you want to try this too
often
whoa there might have been some frame in
that well it be the first thing he
hasn't it clean
tonight Mr curios is challenging a call
on the service line the ball's got in we
saw fugini earlier this week punching
his strings oh no I I want to dwell on
that that that was beautiful mark
[Applause]
p SC line all right 305 second
[Music]
1405 is Heros is challenging the on the
right you guys have probably watched a
lot more of's matches than I have and
called them but does he or doesn't he
change his grunt at times to try and
affect the other guy
100% curios has two he gets elongated
and he also gets delayed right there he
gave a delayed grunt well after he made
that
hit
game adal trying to not be distracted by
what's going on down the other end of
the moment
ruin the whole he just ruins the whole
flow of the game man like it's not it's
not it's not a game I'm giving 130% and
he can't get lons calls right it's not
it's not fun it's not a
game sometimes having nothing in your
head is the best thing he kind of
created that for
himself 15 love
[Applause]
50 n
[Applause]
pap
[Applause]
did he just miss the easiest
one have you ever seen anything like it
though at a point like that the
magnitude of the moment 15 1 what about
Rafa's effort here on each and every one
of these
balls thank you
pure
persistence let's for
service made it can you believe is
challenging a call on the left Far Side
line I think he made it but this miss it
I mean he he wanted to go there but he
catch he catches the frame on
this and that takes a little bit of luck
to drop in when you hit the frame like
that that ball could have gone a meter
out has one challenge remaining
[Applause]
well that's a Cy little shot right
there fake drop shot 43 Rafa actually
was drawn forward a little bit and then
he chipped it deep enough that he had to
recover and play it from behind him yeah
well it wasn't Bluff that he was going
to hit the drop shot because that's what
he did earlier in the
[Applause]
match it's certainly creative
juice when it works we Marvel over it
yeah and when it
doesn't when you prepare like that
though you know the opposition thinks
you're going to hit a drop shot so he he
came up with it the
unexpected in the previous Point tried
it again but player thinks you're going
to drop drop shot if you're the
opposition
there it dropped in surely I think it
dropped in didn't it this is his last
challenge if he goes to the challenge he
is going to the challenge is challenging
a call on the right Baseline the ball
scored out well it was a mish hit wasn't
it it loed high and the linesman here
could be probably forgiven for thinking
I think it's long F I think his Camp
have told him it's
long
wow okay hell of a
call Advantage
[Applause]
curios Mr Nadal how close he was to
bring an up a set point there was no way
out of that had it dropped in for
curios there is
now there's an escape through right to
the tie
break
juice possibly missed the easy shot of
of the of the game simple forehand there
hits
long not out of the pressure valve
yet Advantage
curios a heck of a valley from that
position just wondering at what point
Rafa is going to take one of these
returns cross every time this point has
been played he's gone
line and Nick has had a backhand
volley and Nick is covering line very
early
there went for the fake underarm serve
there curios
well he saw him coming in didn't
he Nadal saw the ser and volley on the
second ball him coming forward and it
just made him rush get a bit tight it so
short here we go this is uh in the
balance now
now I just feel like there's so many
things going on within what's happening
in the match right now I thought a
couple points ago you guys tell me if
you heard this but I thought Rafa did an
elongated grunt back at Nick in the
middle of one of the points
identical score line to wimbl in their
last meeting last
year 63 to Nadal 3-6 to Kos second third
set went to a breaker just like this
one those are the memories that both
these two will be thinking about right
now mini opportunity with a second serve
for cuos on the opening point
can work both ways can't it after a long
service game like that from cuos a 65 to
get into the tiebreaker he's been
serving recently but Nadal has also had
a good look at it for a while
Carlos moo was looking very
relaxed
21 NAD you know I always think these
touch shots Under Pressure harder than
actually Swinging with racket head speed
at the ball but it's just in his natural
repertoire isn't it and also didn't buy
the cross cor Nadal loves to go with a
sort of Cony grip flick it crosscourt
hard and Kos was brave enough to stay
down the line
uh-oh uh-oh why Nick 3-1
[Applause]
ad it's a good question Fitz it's a good
question
why why at this moment warning
mros mean's he's also got a new rest
strength which will feel possibly
different to the to the one he just
[Music]
had thank you hands of
stone that's a bit unfair
[Music]
I just wonder whether there was
something within Nick that felt as
though he needed to disrupt what was
happening out there whether he lost the
Rhythm and he thought that was his best
way of just introducing a bit of Mayhem
into
proceedings yeah you wonder if he if
he's calculated there a little bit I I
agree with you it's it's like watching
an NBA game when the coach makes a
decision to get himself thrown out of
the
game Fitz isn't buying
it I just think it's the constant
pressure here a must
hold 4
[Applause]
two raer keeping him in the tiebreaker
by an easy Miss yeah I just don't know
why he needed to break the Rhythm he was
3-1 yeah okay down a mini break so what
he's playing to such a high level he's
been under stress though for a good
eight minutes hanging on to his service
game and to be honest he's been under
stress since 4-3 ever since he did the
first underarm serve he's been working
hard and I think that was just his
boiling
point well he's managed to get through
that last Point by pitch he's still
within Striking Distance now he 4-2
and me to say he doesn't like this game
and all of those things but you look at
his schedule again I just don't buy it
you know after this he's going to New
York he's going to Del re he's going to
aapco he's flying back to Australia
Davis Cup he's going Indian worlds Miami
that doesn't sound like a guy that
doesn't love this sport and understand
this sport inherently
there it was second
service the one we've talked about the
huge second serve taking a
risk well now now he's got a chance R
has missed two easy forehand in this
tiebreaker back to back 4 three
[Applause]
NAD tell you what James Kong was very
generous when he hit the start button on
the shot clock
[Music]
there I was looking I thought he might
be in a bit of trouble these are such
significant points for Nadal you knew he
was going to take a long time he's been
given it
May him play that's all he did 53 NAD
that ball fell off the strings too I
wonder maybe it's a long shot and
grasping
for grasping for something to hang on to
but was that the a different rering
Maybe not maybe bit too tight maybe not
but it was a bad Miss he Mish hit it
[Music]
by four NAD despite the execution on the
previous point I like the fact that
curios was looking to make something
happen keeping the pressure on Rafa
making him come up with something
by
ball Nick hold in the balls to serve how
big is this
[Applause]
point gra has helped his cause here miss
two easy for Hands by his
[Music]
standards the 11 di By The Sword
Nick 65 I wish I'd said it but I had a
feeling he was going to go so huge on
that point well we're all thinking it
because there was always a chance but
217 you went for pH and that might cost
him the whole night right there he went
224 on the first serve biggest serve of
the night and you just sensed that he
was going to try and go with something
really big
[Applause]
again and what's crazy is he didn't miss
it
long it was just wide he had the length
but that double brings up set point for
Nadal please
W that that was a baby crying in the
stands there took his attention away
there
Nadal what a couple of points well he
hesitated cuz he heard he heard a baby
crying no doubt no doubt about it
but the pressure of the moment also
created that and you would expect expect
Raphael Nadal to execute a second serve
even with that short
break wow
drama in the last two points we've seen
four
serves nothing
else two absolutely massive points
[Music]
well a lifetime of doing the right thing
allows you to have the self-belief that
you're going to come out on top his
forehand has been a little flaky by his
high standards in this breaker but he
saw his opportunity and how's that for a
finish that was not easy no that was
awkward it was a bit High to be
easy the courage to hit that forehand
and to follow it and come
forward set point number two
It Feels Like Everything to Rafael Nadal
and understandably so two a lead of two
sets to one and can curios possibly come
back from this
[Music]
question
answer from both guys not a bad point
from Nick curios
no ruer That Swing cannot be much better
the footwork to that ball the contact
Point what a St to the
four
kol well
to win a
major you have to be able to play at
this level for a long time in several
matches many matches seven in
fact so two more sets is needed from
curios at that same levels were
seen
13 I think this has been really
impressive how he's come out
y so often one or the other of the
players after a breaker like that has a
drop off in
level I I know that players that serve
as big as this Brad they get a lot of
free points there they don't have to be
as fit probably as someone like who
plays like Nadal but I'm I'm surprised
with kuro's uh stamina here especially
after his previous five Setter game I
wasn't sure he's you'd be able to last
like
this first game
foret yeah I think all of us felt that
coming into the match the the question
we talked about it early on was going to
see how Nick had survived and recovered
from that
match but we haven't seen any signs of
difficulty in movement fatigue it's been
explosive out there L on water Lon water
I think it's as well as I've ever seen
any move 2 days after that five Setter 4
hours 20
minutes we've talked about how big the
the Serv is that's one of the things
when when you lose your legs a little
bit you tend to start to drop off on the
execution on sered he's still serving
unbelievable 76% overall for the match
[Applause]
he
[Applause]
love
[Applause]
te well he didn't lift that as much as
he was intending to but it may well lift
his spirits
you hear Nick saying how is he hitting
that he's been hitting it for a couple
of dickes exactly
[Applause]
I just find also comment like that can
can boy your opposition 13 it's sort of
a little bit of an excuse for Raa to
Puff his chest out and say yeah he's
feeling it it's I'm hitting the ball
heavy sort of inspires him a little bit
I think telling the opposition how well
they're playing
[Applause]
14 an old coach of mine that coached a
guy you'll know Fitz Eric Van
Dillan used to say that was called
aiding and abetting the enemy
yes telling me how good he's playing is
that what you mean or how bad you're
playing I can't hit a backand I love
it game Nadal
one game all Nick just flexing his left
leg
there and I think at 2 hours and 43
minutes into the match this fourth set
and if we go on to a fifth set we'll
start to see how much that match really
affected Nick the other night right now
ref is wishing this was best of
[Laughter]
seven lets for service
oh off
is there some frying around the
edges love the
team from nickam maybe that's a bit
early to tell but a strange approach
there I
thought yeah it's uh I think it's a
little tiny bit early a prognosticate
right here but you do sense that he's
dropped off with just a tiny bit of the
energy
that's a bad sign that is a bad sign
love that that missed by a long
way and yet up the other end of the
Court there is
a player who is just applying himself
consistently Point by point to the
process
FS Mr curios is challenging the call on
the left near side line the ball SC
out 34% only of his second serve points
one tonight he was above 50% coming in
here the perent swing to Nadal on this
point now
significant and he wasn't going to let
that opportunity pass
by and I think one of the most telling
things that you can watch for during a
match
is the movement of a player in between
points Nick has become very very very
slow
here just not that same sense of urgency
that the score line created for him in
the last set yeah these are no normal
break points are they
yeah you feel like the ridings on the
wall that third set was everything it
wouldn't have been if Nadal had dropped
it but for curios it seems as though
there is no way back now leads but two
games to
one just a little bit of movement find
Kos there
[Music]
15 low
[Applause]
I think trying to push himself to fight
looking like he wants to be there but
those kind of errors are going to weigh
heavily on
him you have to you admire nadala don't
you you you cannot be a tennis fan and
not admire this
guy the intensity that he maintains over
long periods of time is just as good as
the game's ever
seen yeah and it's a total misconception
about his style of play as well we often
get so bogged down looking at one
person's sort of superior quality that
we forget about the sum total of
everything 4 and that is his second
serve which is the best ever by the way
in terms of career points one and also
he's just a mere Five Points behind
curios in terms of Ventures to the net
tonight you know he's more than happy to
get up there and finish points
oh yes
Nadal another scorching winner that
illuminates the nighttime sky and Nadal
is on his way to the quarterfinals leads
by three games to
one
well there's three games to go but I I
hear you Mark and uh I just wonder if
Nick does go away a little bit in this
fourth set and it if it is one side the
question for me would be what if he had
to won that third could he have
maintained it at a higher level in the
fourth compared to what's happening
right
now because it's been a it's only a
sudden drop but it's there isn't
it if is the biggest word in the English
language is it
[Applause]
love
te it's almost as big as
prognosticate it certainly has bigger
connotations and that's my
point if Nick had made that second serve
at five in the breaker down the te at
2117 for an ace would we have been
singing his Praises for his
courage
W I don't know if you'd Call it Courage
I think you might call it risk
taking risk for award maybe but he
certainly lives and dies by it doesn't
he
tell you what he's competing
still
1 no matter what the result that for me
I admire the most if he can continue to
compete here to the line he's going to
that will stand him in good Stead for
the next Grand Slam he plays
in and it's not beyond the Realms of
possibility that if heat that long he
could get back into this but he he
certainly dropped off in the first
couple of games of this fourth as long
as he keeps this within one break he's
got a shot mhm
which he does effectively with a hold of
serve and a little glance down there's
still life in this
match leads by three games to two 32
Nadal fourth
[Music]
15 just going to extract a little bit
more from those legs of my
opponent got there in plenty of
time just pushed that way too
deep had no under spin on the ball so it
continu continued through the court and
Rafa was there so
easily kind confirming it was out
[Music]
as a classic theal point I mean he just
didn't take any risk but he just kept
Kos moving and was behind the M well
actually he's at the other end deep
behind the Baseline maneuvering him from
side to side just putting work in on
those
legs he knows that there's a cumulative
effect of what he's done so far through
this match it's going to have a huge
effect on Nick
getting a little looser isn't he with
his shot selection and the the way he's
approaching hitting those those
shots slapping the ball a bit the
previous point he did so much work yeah
and he was actually in a decent position
to make a good forehand there and he
chooses to slap it 10 ft
long well he went behind him twice like
you guys have selected in the one rally
Nick continuing to add some
entertainment valy he came down hard
there you can hear that
[Applause]
stump how good was the
volley I mean the whole point it was so
well crafted from Nadal he knows he's
got his opponent as we see the dive from
cuos right onto his hip there
let's have another listen to
this
oh came down Square on his
[Applause]
hip there it is that cross return you
were talking about Brad
and the end is nigh here isn't it
the the train is just gaining momentum
here for
Nadal 15
every Point huge right now for curios
both physically and
mentally as he makes unfor airs or Rafa
wins the points outright you can see it
just plays on his mind a little bit more
at this point in the
match
13 still got that capability
though well that's the technique isn't
it that's what Pete saner had he could
serve like that for four and a half
hours easily first serves at that pace
beautiful
technique Nick has what we like to call
a live arm
yeah 30
that's been a play that's worked very
nicely for him return into the forehand
get his feet up the court on the
Baseline takes his backand three quter
angle out wide to Kos and create space
for
him Kos needs to dial up another first
serve
here and he does
4 it's way so dangerous isn't it and and
a player like this
who has flare and ability outside of his
service games but can serve like this
for a long period of time is always
dangerous yeah there's been a lot about
his performance tonight that made me
think about his
2017 segment of the year in Acapulco
where he beat jovic he was bombing
second serves on those occasions there
but saving break points for fun against
the world number two lost to query in
the final there be jovic again in Indian
worlds another stunning performance and
then that one against federa of course
where he lost in the breaker three
tiebreak sets in
Miami that was the time where we kind of
felt he had arrived and things are
[Applause]
gelled but that hasn't always been the
case subsequent to that I think it's
wanting to compete
every day that will it's a habit for
raer yeah if Nick does that he he will
be a much better
[Music]
play there still a pulse in this contest
no question about it now canos figure
out a way to break back
F know we know how good Rafer is we
still don't know how good Nick curios is
we don't
know and for me the thing that has made
me smile more than anything about this
is how he has
competed we'll start to understand how
good he is if he does that
consistently took about tennis plays
tough Ashton Eaton the gold medalist in
Rio a kathle one of the world's best
said tennis players he said in tennis as
a sport is the second toughest sport in
the world after his own of
course but that was high
PR 13
[Applause]
15 he has 10 disciplines to think about
Nick just his own
[Music]
14 we can't talk about it enough how
Rafa just continues to stay there
execute put the
pressure and rarely ever Miss A B
another aspect of his game that's
underrated so
underrated but this Camp was excited
when they they've seen this movie before
they've seen him come through tougher
battles than this and come out on top in
finals of these Majors this was a test
make no mistake about it
yeah this match was in the balance for a
long time Mark wasn't it Y game and he's
got the kind of game of course that is
so erratic and yet so powerful that it
throws the big players off their Rhythm
and that's something they like to do
three Mr curios has one challenge
remaining the third set was some of the
best
tennis that you could have possibly
imagined
and yet it still wasn't good enough for
curios to come out on top that's the bar
that these big three set 15
love I do think with Nick like you're
talking about Fitz that if you look
generationally every generation has had
a guy that's been a little bit of the
the bad guy the uh the guy that did
things a little
[Music]
differently is that does that have a
direct
underachieving that sometimes but at the
same time you have nstasia back in his
day Connor was a bit of
a edgy guy obviously Johnny Mack but but
they they never gave in on a point never
that's the difference yeah
[Music]
you watch Nadal there after what is that
now 3 hours and 10 minutes you watch his
movement off the ball if we get a chance
to see it he flicks that one on he has a
look down look at him move and then he's
able to take it inside the Baseline took
away the time for kios to
recover his algorithm is still very
Lively
[Applause]
the rala starting to measure him for the
coffin
403 lovely delivery there from curios
off Pace short
angled still enough life in those legs
to do
that 10:30 T night and he's just about
to visit the Last Chance Saloon
curios madal will come out and serve for
the match
[Applause]
thank you they deserve it
love
team well we talk about a game of
centimeters don't we Nick's ball caught
the line by centimet there probably and
rfh has missed it by one and then the
crowd gets involved
and we talk time and time again about
how important these first points in the
game are creating
momentum creating
hope back behind
him twice 15 know that that b could have
easily gone into the net there there was
under Slice on the curios Chip And when
you under when you slice under the ball
here like this the spin will take the
ball down into the net so Rafa there
opened the face just that little bit
more
[Applause]
[Music]
he
cany I don't
know I don't know if he can but if he
competes like this there's always a
chance he's been helped by a few Miss
serves in this game he could do with
another one
[Applause]
here thank you
please scarce ly credible twice tonight
he served a double fold on a big moment
Nadal when he was serving for the third
in the breaker he
recovered can he do so
again we just don't expect to see Rafa
being the one who
blinks thank
you ready for play
let's for
[Music]
service let's first service
so
thir
14 Nick choosing to just push that
backand gave rafo all the time to run
around thank you please and in doing so
lost a little bit of control of his own
destiny still has break point
though unbelievable scenes here in
Melbourne and having kept the deficit to
just one
game curios finds a way back into the
contest nal's first serve just left the
arena he has an uncanny ability to hit
good balls good shots on big moments
doesn't
he how good was that last forehand
love
the continuing to go to that play slider
wide look for the backhand volley Raa
just floating that return up so hard to
control that from up
there Fitz how do you feel about his
competing now after that last game no he
he's got me tonight
love 1
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
15 1ou
we mentioned it much earlier in the
match but for a while now Rafa has been
doing a much better job of playing
behind
Nick trying to go behind him again there
from our vantage point we could see the
line wide open thought he was going
there
Mr curios is challenging a call on the
left Baseline how's this a responsible
gra though doesn't drop his head for one
second does he I know he in his own mind
thinks well why would you but it's it's
simple in his world yeah he He's A
Mental Giant when he competes
154 and there's nobody better in the
game at breaking back more challenges
remaining
[Applause]
as you Americans like to call it the
rebre it looks like it's
coming geros getting the benefit from
serving and
voling must have CAU Nadal's eye to see
whether the Australian was on his way in
there he wasn't
[Applause]
[Music]
flat wide or
t we know it's going to be big
[Applause]
extraordinary
scenes the Australians in the crowd
upstanding and
euphoric edge of your seat stuff
here juice can you imagine what's going
to happen if this goes to five
thank
you advantage to us
an extraordinary effort from Nick Kel
they look down and out
madal fails to serve it out and curious
lead six five in the
fouram ready for
play 15 love
[Applause]
[Music]
I bet he would have paid a bit of money
actually to have two first serves like
that in the in two games ago Brad serve
deserted him
then two good ones
here 4
what did you say serving out a matx was
difficult even for the best
14
15 game Nadal
heck of a response from the number one
after the previous service
game each player receives an additional
challenge exactly the same score line as
we had in won last
year adal be hoping for the same outcome
he won the foret breaker there
let's for service
[Music]
[Applause]
1 Z
[Applause]
nadam and the hits keep on coming for
Kos but he's done such a good job
tonight of regrouping
[Applause]
on
[Applause]
one that could have got ugly for Nick
curios there couldn't it
grafford catches that on the frame he
went for broke but he was given the
opportunity
21
Nadal he really found his serve again
through that last
game and now into the breaker
[Music]
two
[Music]
is challenging the call on the right
near sideline the ball scored in oh
there's a sense in the commentary box
that that is wide this is such a huge
shot from cuos he was working AAL over
here and it is
32
curious Mr Nadal has three challenges
remaining again just impressed with how
hard Nick has been working to find his
for
[Applause]
hand thank
you read it just couldn't find
it three
[Applause]
[Applause]
so
close but yet potentially so far
the essence of sport is the uncertainty
and we've certainly had that
tonight we knew it was going to be a
blockbuster we were unsure of So Many
Factors
though but as this match has unfolded it
has kept delivering as has madals on the
last couple of points with his serve he
needs that to continue
what a transformation on that shot
compared to when he tried to serve out
the match at 54 in the
[Applause]
set couple of significantly faster
serves in this tiebreaker than his
average for the match that one coming in
at 193 can curios respond
[Music]
[Applause]
calamitus
53 well he's one points on that shot on
big points because he's caugh raer by
surprise but it is not easy to take the
pace off a ball when it's tight and your
nerves
are your nerves
afraid he blows it that time down a mini
break
[Applause]
well this is outstanding boy have we
been entertained all of
us and those forehand just beg the
question why play the drop shot on the
point before when you've got a weapon
like that in Your Arsenal you're inside
the Baseline the ball's shoulder height
he could have crushed that forand
anywhere but that's Nick curios
[Applause]
[Music]
this match as it was at 5-4 in the
fourth back on the DS racket two good
service points we'll see him through to
the
quarterfinals
64 Nadal
thank
you two match points
[Music]
sets to one what a night for the what a
night for
Nadal the Victor but cuos can hold his
head up high he came to fight arguably
the toughest competitor the sports ever
seen he was second best against the
world's best
