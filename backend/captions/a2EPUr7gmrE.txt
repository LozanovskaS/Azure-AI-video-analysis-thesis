when the draw came out I think everybody
uh wanted to uh janigan and myself uh
play in the
semi-finals I think is uh one of the
most difficult challenge that uh we can
face in the tennis right now it's
difficult to play against
him I want to measure myself on the clay
no it's it's a surface where I struggle
a lot sometimes and especially in the
beginning so I'm even more happy to be
in the
[Applause]
semis the way that he hit the ball is uh
unbelievable he push uh you to the limit
in in every
ball you have to run like it is a a
marathon Rock Solid now he wants the
crowd I a player who likes have this
kind of challenge really difficult one
semi-finalists there are special
occasions you know on on Center Court
against uh special players so a great
occasion to show some good things

got there in the end on that one what a
glorious day this is as well I mean this
amazing this court always the matches
that we have here but look at the
backdrop here this is pretty much
ideal for the match that everyone's
talking
about don't Tire those images do you one
of the great courts in the world in this
wonderful sport guy McCree delighted to
be with you and delighted to be as
always particularly on a day like this
to be alongside 17 time Grand Slam
doubles Champion Mark Woodford Mark good
afternoon to you it's funny isn't it
when you when you come up here to the
commentary B you walk around there's
always a buzz but just get the feeling
today with the these two going
head-to-head this is something else in
Prospect here let's look at them in
detail uh first of all starting with the
Australian Open champion and the man who
will be the new world number one on
Monday well yeah exactly and good
afternoon to you guy and everyone tuning
in to this Mega Match this is lron match
of the tournament and Yanna of course
newly anointed number one ranked player
and I wonder you and I were also
discussing as we came on a is that
something that could disturb Yan the
fact that he's already arrived at number
one is that a distraction or is he able
to comp marelize and and just have those
blinkers on
and take
on yeah because I mean he's been
excellent as we see through the
tournament s just the one set you
commentated that one where he had
difficulties with the Frenchman Coran
tamut but solved the puzzle absolutely
it's it's putting the jigsaw uh pieces
together and uh the first set that's the
beauty of the five set format there's
there's no Panic
calmness there's a a good friend of
mine Darren kah from from Adelaide we
grew up playing together and uh he's
been a welcome addition to team
c s Simone vanoi is the head coach the
lead
coach they have a of others a
trainer Fitness coach Etc that are part
of the team but Darren K has been boy I
think a tremendous influence and helped
impact the outcome of that Australian
Open final yeah and that will help him
obviously here as he goes now into the
back end of this tournament um one of
his opponent here though the uh the
current Wimbledon champion I mean both
these two had let's remember had injury
concerns as well coming in here uh s
with the hit alcaras in terms of the
forearm but again similar things you can
say of him he's been tremendous with his
tennis through most of the rounds here
yeah
it's the more matches that they get to
play the longer they stay in the
tournament the more dangerous they
become and now we get them playing
head-to-head so this is what the
anticipation is about these two are the
next generation of men's
tennis started off you know solid
against JJ wolf unfortunately JJ is just
not at home on the clay so a nice warm
up pushed in that second match a lot of
talk about that second round against
dong but he's just moved through
calmly today's
semifinal he's got a former Winer of De
musketeer in his Corner as well I mean
what a bonus you talk about having
Darren kahill for C but equally for
alcarez to have the mosquito as he was
known in your corner is superb totally I
it is for me it's one of the key
components for the Marquee guys when
they've arriving at this stage to have
that experience that they can tap into
from people who have experienced it
themselves yeah we'll get into this um
I'm not sure we can do this in 20 to 30
seconds go through the head to head I
think there's some points to draw out of
it you see it's for all there breaking
it down a little bit for now it's one
all at the majors um overall there uh
first time they're meeting
separate and thats to the time on court
just minutes between
them you know you can spend hours Mark
pouring over different metrics to do
with this and we'll bring some of that
out but it's just on in so many respects
it's on an knif edge this one it it it
it is so equally balanced and uh you
know we're we're here we're supposed to
try and break it down it is hard I think
it it's almost like a a horse race if
you if you have a favorite color
[Music]
of the the silks um then you know that's
who you end up picking I think it is
going to be evenly matched in this match
in this this encounter um for those at
home if they wherever they are tuning in
for this put your seat belt on get ready
for this heck of a ride I think we're
going to be here for a bit
[Music]
[Applause]
this has the potential to be the match
of the event let's see if it lives up to
the hype two current Grand Slam
champions going head-to-head for the
ninth time first time
here alcaras to
[Applause]
begin chance Z
oh
[Applause]
just warming up there teasing each other
out early
exchange
[Music]
[Applause]
turn going be a few rallies like that
[Applause]
that through as well
s j
[Applause]
punt hareth taking the back end on
quite get the
[Music]
[Applause]
angle it's fascinating Mark you know
just I think looking round chatrier as
well everyone settling in you made that
point you know buckle up Enjoy the Ride
Along They Know Each Other's gam so well
and it's it's funny although they there
are
differences this this you know you look
at their games they're very very little
in the way of weaknesses I think that's
why so many of the sets in the past have
been so
tight you know there's there's a little
bit to put across you there's a little
bit Al as you've made through this
tournament made the point again
explosive CER is more You could argue
more
methodical but you look at their the big
strengths they've got what they do
well there's just there's not a lot to
choose between them in many respects
yeah I you know just to a name a quick
few I mean they're forehand dominant
movement
exceptional back hands are extremely
solid they both transition to the
net extremely well first serve packed
with some
punch and it's maybe alcarez just a
slight Edge as far as the experience in
Grand Slam finals but it is close
having won the Australian
Open he getting used to that grand sland
feel's uh parents uh in attendance
here around of course earlier on in this
uh this second week
[Music]
[Applause]
oh a touch from cner and an early pump
of the Fist the way these two have
started I mean this is just the opening
game but Steely
looks from both of
them yep and both have in points in this
first game got to net both have used
their forehand algra already throwing in
the drop
shot Mira and draa there standing up of
course was semi-finalist in the women's
draw the
[Applause]
[Applause]
teenager avantage
C Okay so
first break point in the opening game
and just According to some of the the
the data it's at these moments where
yanic
Senna doesn't hold back on a break point
he's not uh paralyzed tight he actually
increases ball speed
[Applause]
naras cracks there a break here for
sinner underlining the dial in start
he's made to this one the
Italian and that feedback G is from an
accumulation of all the matches that
they've played thus far at Roland garos
in that particular rally it did look
like that alare was had more uh weight
of shot off the forehand that he was
looking for the forehand unfortunately
finding the net the final for
[Applause]
him last Italian to win here
Franchesca 210o that was a little
Italian Twist on your tongue there guy
yeah wonder how the natives would rate
it out of 10 some of them on our heads
they're coming in and saying
Bravo Yanik well she could play
certainly and uh sin's come to play here
predictably with this
start this Italian man to hit the top of
the ATP rankings massive un
significant they're having a just a a
fantastic run in tennis in general of
course tomorrow the final with palini
what a story that's
been CH
Z philippo valandre I'm there as well I
mean everyone's here today they keep our
team busy aren't they with all these uh
all of them in attendance you can
understand why everyone wants to see
this match
yeah hottest ticket in
town skon also participating in the
Legends
event as a former singles champion and
of course valandre he is the current
Davis Cup captain so he is
watching uh his number one player no
doubt hoping that he will commit to
playing Davis Cup later in the
year Z yeah of course the title
defense with Italy having won that at
the end of last season you talk about
Sinner's development we naturally focus
a lot on the Australian Open
Crown Winning Davis up seen it countless
times how it can set you up to go on and
Achieve even greater things he seems to
be another example of
that just another one another winner
from
cner this is this is starts not too
shabby is it from the Italian not at all
have a look at the the B balance when he
moves out to the
left two-handed backand and it it really
reminds me of I mean I'm not a great
skier uh guy I'm not sure you how how
polished you are on the ski slopes but
you know the way that he just slides
over to that back end and comes to a
stop it it really is and he is an
accomplished skier
uh so they say
[Applause]
well in the start that he's made C know
the point you make Mark actually I mean
where he's from uh as well in Italy the
tiell and what he was doing watch some
stuff of him growing up because that was
the sport that he excelled in first of
all and said a few times I'll say again
again we are so grateful that he
transitioned over uh to tennis and what
what he's gone on to do but uh yeah the
movement actually you talked about going
out wide to the that if you watch him
actually skiing in terms of sliming slm
technique it's extremely
similar St there from meanwhile can
to five unforced erors already here
[Applause]
not quite getting a chunk of the return
but what he's done well in the
tournament yanic CER is is be willing to
actually step in closer to the Baseline
if not inside the Baseline compared to
the other three players that are alive
in the tournament
[Applause]
[Music]
now injected that bit of pace and it's
tough to rush either of
them forced them into an error what he
was able to do
there really impressed with with the
quality of the start from C
here he posed the question rightly you
know coming into this cuz there was so
much talk about possibilities of going
to world number one and getting that and
the way that he got
it all the talk was yeah get to the
final that was the emphasis
[Applause]
yep wait started here he's it's almost
like okay I've moved on from that
already that's going to be confirmed on
Monday now I want my second major
title yeah which is it's not an easy
thing uh to to achieve I I think more
often than not that you arrive at number
one after
winning whether it's a big tournament or
a 500 series I mean it's it's it's more
about you accomplish it after winning a
tournament so it's a rare occasion that
what he's experience and it
hasn't turned him
off settling alai here in these early
stages cner that as we know is extremely
difficult to do he's managing it he's
two breaks up here the Italian three
love opening set
I
[Applause]
[Applause]
so what a start it's been here to this
first semi-final from Yanik sinner the
second seed
two breaks
up Italian on Spain Carlos alcar
[Applause]
here amazing really looking at the uh
both these two claiming their 50th Grand
Slam main draw match
wins previously in this tournament how
similar their numbers are in that
respect as
well and extending it out as well now
that theyve both achieved that they'll
go on and Achieve an awful lot more but
50 major match wins how they compare
with those three greats as well very
similarly is the is the headline take
from
[Applause]
that can't
[Applause]
zero rematch here there the left of
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
picture we expect it to be tight over
the longer Hall this is still early
stages and what is of course a best of
five but uh
sinner here on the brink of carving a
pretty
handy opening section here on
alcara
game back to back love games by
[Applause]
here looking to get behind alare here
yet to get on the board
[Applause]
[Applause]
this
he was kind of he had the first
opportunities there the spard but his
ball his rally ball here not massively
at the moment troubling
c s able to easily inject
Pace almost like in in that exchange
there again mark it was like right is
that what you've
got's doing most of the the dictating in
that point without being able to
decisively get CER out of position
[Music]
turns
off long way to go but I think the
feeling around here everyone's a little
bit stunned by nature of this start to
the semi-final or maybe alare just
starting to think back to the last time
they did play Indian Welles early this
year lost that first set 61 so that
was certainly a one-sided start alare
ended up coming back and winning 63 62
so wouldn't think that there's much
Panic uh at the end of the spard just
[Applause]
yet first V come on from a it's it's a
very you know the fact that it's their
most recent meeting but the fact that he
as you say it was a one-sided opening
set lost that 61 came back uh alcar has
to win the second and third set 63 and
62 to move through course going on to uh
to win there defend his title in the
desert Messi
that will get him
going so a bit different rally that was
played in that last Point bit more shape
coming from both guys the point before
that was more of a
muscle rally that alare came out on
top certainly accelerated on the final
forehand up the
line alar Spaniard on the board he
needed
that Sen
still leading commandingly though at
4-1 yeah I mean just back on the point
mark with that you know we talk about
this new era I mean they've played this
is their ninth time playing already 50
match wins but is remarkable you look at
Compare the numbers I supposed to to be
here at at the
beginning that's something there was in
the alcarez but you know with this Jo
ovic Nadal federa overall to 50 wins
where they're at the number of the
number of major titles they'd won at
that point as well very similar indeed
uh the numbers there I mean for instance
alcar is exactly the same as raford
raford had won three rolling gals by
then of course but 50 from 60 to that
point
yep
Rob little bit weaker but still very
good actually two matches less than
fedra took to get to 50 wins for
instance for the
[Applause]
Italian just over 20 minutes gone here
first
semifinal
sinner first four games seen Carlos
alare get his first hold but is is a
double break Advantage for for sinner
here
4-1 the lead here the Italian first
[Music]
[Applause]
set used the drop shot so well to set up
the Finish yeah that's CH something that
he probably will explore through this
match I mean alare in the tournament has
not varied his court position to return
anyone's first
serve uses the expansiveness of this
court Philip
[Applause]
chatrier there are comparisons with
Nadal in that way we've seen over the
years in this return
position valkar I think you're alluding
to
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
he backs himself with how explosive he
can be from anywhere on the court alar
that he can do
that
canza so for
sinner today not to really looking to
get caught too deep behind the Baseline
and where he's having to extend out to
the backhand Wing his backhand slice is
a is a shot that he's worked on
conscientiously since Darren Kaho has
arrived on the on the
scene it's not bad he gets a bit of
knife on the
ball when he's closer to the Baseline
when he's quite deep it has a tendency
to just float and we saw that on the
last point just a an easier ball for
alare to punish
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
I just found sin's comments about
playing on Clay really interesting with
this being asked about the opponent here
but about what the way he's gone about
it he's saying you know it takes a
different sort of tennis from me from
playing on a hardcore
that can be over in Two Shots three
[Applause]
shots ah here he goes now again
excellent
feel in the lob from alcara there
T from not the best of volleys
see that he got
to bit close to the volley didn't get
any punch on
[Applause]
[Music]
it it's a big distance there isn't it
alarv is giving
who not a whole lot of change this is a
second serve and he's back that
far
hant feel like that was the bait right
there that alare sent up the other end
of the Court we know that
Sinner's favorite forehan is that when
he's moving out to the juice Court just
Kareem's the forehand up the line he
crunched it on that occasion but missed
it
wide first chance to break here in the
match for alcar
[Music]
he's coming into things more now
everyone was a bit stunned by the first
four games but just can't expect it to
go on that way with the quality at both
ends of the Court here what these two
possess what they can deliver first
break for the
Spaniard this is a it's we've build it
as Lon match
and just thinking back to alcar he
hasn't played since
Madrid trying to get the the
Reps it might have been just a little
tentative at the
start zer
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
100 K there he's been up in the event so
far alcare up to 217
K in the tournament just looking at
their speeds as with everything else
good luck trying to find a a significant
differential yeah you'll be looking for
a long time
[Applause]
I can tell you that because I
tried Games built to as they've been
doing built to prosper on all surfaces
including here on the Roland gal clay
this is the the clay of course that he
grew up
on do you give him an edge in that way
overall but I mean siners spent the time
playing on it as well indeed
[Music]
car
tense was saying with cner as well you
know that point I think worth restating
again as opposed to hard courts he says
you know I need to concentrate more I
feel on Clay cuz I got to play more
balls I got to play more shots on a
hardcore I can finish it quickly harder
to do that here as we all
[Applause]
know but I think it gives an inside
into the opponent here and how he's
approach how he approaches his clay
court tennis even more sinner that he
needs that Focus every point right from
the start and that's how he started this
semi-final
[Music]
[Applause]
was really put under the pump there ALC
kathew feel through that
point short with his rally ball felt sin
was the boss there
[Applause]
throughout there's that forehand up the
line that is uh breathtaking alra did
extremely well with his back end slice
but not on the final one maybe trying to
do something that is too
precise wasn't going to win the point I
don't believe with the drop shot
[Applause]
[Music]
avantage
s first double the
man doesn't give it much away of course
behind those Shades Juan kis
Ferrero very calm
character C here chance to reestablish
the double break
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
he wa to
mate for go
[Applause]
[Music]
a bit surprised must say with this game
started
out
as a game for alcare Led 405 but it's
just become
messy right on the precipice of him
starting to work his way back in with
that break of serve could close the gap
down but he's having
to dig hard on this game right now
another break point
[Applause]
oh
no sin's defense
there superb as alar pushed him and
eventually overdid it two break lead is
restored one set later yeah one set
later one set later to be at the
beginning supposed to be here at the
beginning of the match I ask for two
ches
[Applause]
there uh it's been it's not the first
time he's um I believe he expected to
have more ice towels there to
begin was making that point to uh the
Umpire before making the case again
that's unsettled in a little a little
bit you'll be unsettled by this score
line
[Applause]
Ro so perhaps we've reached uh the back
end of this opening set now 34 minutes
in in these glorious conditions in the
bo bin
first set that at the moment is uh going
the way of this
man Yanik sinner back a double break in
front yeah and on that change of ends a
rattle to alare usually a very
well-mannered polite it's not that he
was speaking out of uh context to the
chair rire but
[Applause]
in the big scheme of things I think he's
rattled by the start and the
disappointment of losing his serve in
that last
game just discussing with the chair
umpire about ice tows and does take a
while for them to to actually put them
together wrap tap tape around the ends
[Applause]
serve into the uh into the body yeah CU
that's the thing in itself he can say
Okay I want more ice TOS but it's just
it's it's something there if you like
it's uh it's an example to illustrate as
you say his wider
difficulty in this one so far the uh the
quality of Sinner St to the match
[Music]
p
[Applause]
k
fore spee speech
[Applause]
[Applause]
one or two chances there for the
Spaniards s pulled a little bit was a
bit tentative wasn't he with that with
that pull in the four
Court yeah on the previous point which
he ended up losing C was he didn't
accelerate through the half volley
and maybe de accelerated on one of those
forehand but for alcare to miss that one
that was pretty wild what you know the
scoreboard is against him maybe you
don't have to hit a winner on that final
forehand just get it back into play
[Applause]
low set points against him here in favor
of cner
the Miss hit for hand side from the
Italian straight to the tow here Cent
[Applause]
[Music]
that as well that's the what sort of
point he normally devours Cent serve
plus
one feeling the pressure a bit here as
well
[Applause]
take wits about him there
c
avantage
s this is fascinating the matchup isn't
it as well you're expecting this man to
find an
answer as it goes on and sin so
dependable hasn't been no one those
those two set
points yeah but the beauty of the two
break
lead maybe giving him that
the the idea he can just keep having a
swing
[Music]
out the attempt to drop shot and
S gets what he wants out of that first
set has the initiative here the second
seed taking it 6-2
[Applause]
[Music]
how here looking to make a better start
to the second
set
Z three time winner the miscer other
than
gooa well at least he's out there
sitting the other day we saw him and he
was entertaining upstairs
yeah having a glass of Rosé maybe
watching the match why
[Music]
not I think like all of us uh enjoying
the conditions the sunshine Zer hun
[Music]
[Applause]
just had a brief look at uh The Man
Behind Adidas shoes or Adidas how do you
say Adidas or Adidas Adidas Adidas yeah
that's what I go
with the man behind those shoes Stan
Smith of brands are available they are
but I think he may get a royalty from
those I know when my
daughters came to an event and they
first met Stan Smith they when I
introduced Stan Smith to them they were
just shocked they they didn't really say
anything to him and as he walked away
they they said Dad are you for real
there is a guy called Stan Smith we only
see it on the shoes
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
a
[Applause]
yeah just too much ground to make up
Sim's uh coverage in defense again there
is very good alare is playing it quite
hard to hit through him he he is I you
can hear the effort of course the other
day we heard a complaint that from sitas
that maybe he was grunting too loud but
it is a big effort behind some of these
shots I've been impressed with players
in general this
tournament they seem to be aware of the
Court position of their opponent when
they are deep that drop shot is put in
[Applause]
[Music]
immediately and the ball just getting
back to alare in quick
fashion sen is willing to step closer if
not inside the Baseline to return that
serve and think he just won because it
was a short amount of time for alare to
react and load
up we have another break point for the
Italian he's creating them
regular what please
[Applause]
has been dropping serve uh Alara through
the through the tournament we looked at
his his Road in uh in the warmup there
broken a couple of times I it was a it
was a straightforward win against Wolf
the first round then dong broken five
times by the qualifier twice by cord
once by oer alas SE and once by sitz
pass as well hasn't had a match and see
here he's been broken few times
already
s for all that though it's still to me
look at that about you Mar I just he's
struggling a bit here in his service
games and you don't associate that with
Carlos alare you think of him very high
percentages so for serve and first serve
points one through this
[Applause]
tournament dropped it again broken again
shrug of the
shoulders not happening particularly in
his service games to start this one for
the Spaniard
[Music]
not not getting much value out
of the rally ball in particular the
forehand he hasn't been able to control
that many
rallies behind the forehand mistake
there just pulling the trigger too soon
I don't know if he was in particular in
position have a crack at that backhand
up the line
[Applause]
a
[Applause]
Zer first double of the match for
[Music]
cner sner broken on far fewer occasions
really the outlier for him so far was
that match with M I think at the the
start to it where the Frenchman was
breaking him at will in that first set
but otherwise uh been a bit more
[Applause]
cure
[Music]
K this is unusual to see
this clearly still a bit unsettled here
Al karath at this stage the quality of
what he's getting from cner but also
other things going on there as well
[Applause]
what oh don't forget the
occasion he's aware that his up the
other end is his main opposition for
potentially the next half a dozen years
or more maybe the next decade
[Music]
chter same again for cner there the
double to the G score
[Applause]
[Applause]
yeah
that
solid contact I think that's shining in
a big way that last Point Center is I
think a a repetitive point a solid the
serve was 196 K into the corner ALC
carath is surrendering so much territory
behind the Baseline that as soon as he's
losing any type of length it's just
opening the door for
cner it's a point that you can rely upon
for the cner camp
imaculate
length that's a good example there alare
tried to go for the big cut and
[Applause]
CER yep he not phased at all and and in
fact it goes into the Wheelhouse doesn't
it of off center
if he does try to flatten the ball out I
don't think it's going to
really s is not going to take exception
to it he might be saying Bring It On
[Applause]
yeah it was a very clever drop shot
again got to love that from from C he's
not trying to win the point necessarily
outright there but he knows exactly what
he's doing construction of a really high
level
there yeah that's not a bad point there
G to make the the relevance to playing
with a purpose as opposed osed to alare
who maybe is at this stage trying to win
with certain shots outright not really
try to create or
weave uh the
[Music]
point yeah I was taken with one of the
points you make you've made on
commentary over the years when we work
together on this you know the point you
making in the past maybe players just
played the drop shot clay because
they're Ted and not actually looking you
know the point you were making about
where the opponent is okay this is the
point at which I should play the drop
shot that seems to have changed as you
as you said and these two good examples
of it particularly siners so
far was out a heavy strike there alar I
mean they' both got very very high
numbers of Drop shots uh through through
the tournament but it's deeper than that
as you say what we've seen from in is so
far is that that intelligence in playing
[Applause]
it l Premier Service
[Applause]
another hand second serve last two
points alare directing into the body of
Center trying to crowd
him actually won both of those points
[Applause]
oh
yes delightful touch in the first place
from alcar but he's still had a bit to
do Carl Han
Kens it's a a sweetly played
first half
volley I think that camera angle there
showed that he just waited for the ball
to
[Applause]
come so miss
there whil not into
position off balance trying to go for
quite a a big forehand and
error again from that forehand
[Applause]
[Music]
winges to get through that service game
enough still doesn't look entirely
comfortable though with things
come
let wa wa
[Applause]
Rob p
well this uh Marquee matchup we're
approaching now at the end of the first
hour of it here first hour that has gone
firmly the way of Yanik sinner this is
the uh this semi-final the youngest
Grand Slam
semifinal since the 2008 US
Open it's interesting cuz you know we
were talking about earlier the big three
and their comparison points with how CER
and alcara compare with them to 50 match
win but I think you can put Andy Murray
in the conversation at Major level with
the big three in matchups over the years
as a
contributor not the same level of
achievements clearly but Murray features
in that previous youngest
[Music]
semifinal 2008 where he beat Rafa
Nadal
Z mzma
director
[Applause]
[Applause]
these two young Stars uh going
head-to-head here mention Nadal and
Murray all those years ago and now these
two with alare again looking to get
right into this
match yeah searching for ways to really
ignite the
Jets there are times when you're really
trying to make things happen happen it's
almost like you try too hard get a
little tension in the shoulders in your
arm velocity tends to disappear nerves
can affect players in different ways
sometimes it's their legs that stop them
from their their movement around the
Baseline some get it in the shoulders
where they struggle with the serve
they're not Landing the same
Pace
bols having to it was drifting over to
his left and was two doubles in his
previous service game has lost a little
bit of Rhythm Is that the tension you're
talking about there with uh with
CNA three break back points for
alcara sa
play sa play
[Applause]
[Applause]
boy I felt like that second serve SL
just over the
[Applause]
net relatively short but the bonus there
was that that it also had a bit of Pop
re move up to
[Music]
it C
slips he loses his Advantage here in
this second set the Italian Al karath
breaks back
[Music]
there's just felt that was coming
although he'd held previously the two
doubles you were talking about the toss
just lost a little bit of Rhythm and it
bled into that that service game as well
for
[Applause]
C well very fortunate to to snag that
service
breakdown he almost could have been down
two Brees alcara in this set already so
to grind through that previous
serve closes a gap with a
break is that something that maybe was
in the psyche of cner opportunity to be
up three
love disappeared
[Applause]
I think it comes back to the point
you're making earlier I mean it's a
completely different stage Indian Welles
is a huge event but it's not Roland
garos but you look at them their their
meetings and as you said he's endured a
difficult start there I think he
actually from memory had a very
difficult game at the start of the
second set of that one before he turned
it round as well there so this is the
thing I I mean it's he's got off to a
difficult start in the second as
well but as you say the history is there
he can turn it round got the longer
Dynamic here of course as well more time
[Applause]
[Applause]
so getting into
position to play that volley K once more
going for something too too price too
too short too
[Music]
concise Mary Pierce there winner of the
women's title year 2000
colleague of mine uh sits on the the
board of directors with the ITF and she
was in town for some meetings earlier in
the
week he's also the chairperson of the
billing King Cup
competition iconic
Mary Pierce remember the year that she
won and it's got great footage of her in
a particular rally moving out wide to a
forehand she overran the ball and
actually jumped up into the air and
played the ball between her legs and won
the
point slly snatches at that say she was
ahead of her time a little bit there as
well cuz all the players are trying that
now with varying degrees of uh success
was Casper Roode wasn't there earlier in
the the tournament did manag to pull one
of those off but the success rates are
rather low for all the attempts made
oh
brilliant what a turnaround in that
point from alcara
he ignites the play there Ben still are
applauding
[Applause]
on now 3-2 in the
[Applause]
second and the just the body language
there from alcara a bit better as well
as he went sat down in his chair the
Spaniard three games in a row now here
in this second set for Alara
[Applause]
this was the uh the last
point of that game alare going on to
hold he was again he was put under the
pump for a lot of it which has been the
story of the match but now he's starting
to find some answers some
transitions finding himself into the
lead here in this second set having
trailed a set and two love three games
in a row now for the
Spaniard it's bit of real difficulty in
this uh semi-final you know drop serve
once but the first set the general Paton
was firmly in favor of Yanik
sinner he's lost the last three games
here the
Italian lost a little bit of service
Rhythm as well along the way there it'll
be looking
to regain here he serves again two3 down
in the second
[Applause]
[Applause]
couldn't quite make that alar top of the
tape again though it's it's good use to
the drop shot from
s yeah certainly noticed that alare
was way behind the Baseline and again
it's not necessarily to win the point
outright with the drop shot
it's to have a look at the next ball see
if there's an opportunity to
pass had alare on the stretch with that
forem
[Applause]
volley can
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
there he was slightly inside the uh on
the Baseline slightly inside it there
therefore you'd expect with his
feel alar has to get a lot closer to
making that than he
did notice that cner had actually
slipped not sure that that was the first
idea was to actually try the drop shot
but having noticed that he slipped
coming out of the
corner threw the drop shot in
[Applause]
oh
mistake well it's such a short amount of
time that you get to make a decision in
the direction that you're
going and and this really is a a siss
and at the point of contact he then
realized peripherally that that Ball's
going straight back
to
alare and you can't cover everything he
obviously decided that to at least a
relatively close to the net but he was a
sucker for the LOB
[Applause]
[Applause]
a mistake there that's a calm
Point always said that about the
Spaniard this first hour in a quarter
that was
composed
generating plenty of pace not forgetting
the
idea of coming into
volley it's quite handy when he does
move forward
alarv and this is a significant
turnaround momentum shift in the
match at least this second
set great Point here for a fourth game
in a row it would be
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
a cry of delight the momentum with him
now here
alar breaks cner
again in this second set continues the
run four straight games
now well the the Jets certainly
ignited did I say ignited or United
hopefully I said ignited because that's
what I was wanting to say he is a light
he is taken
off alare right now
it's a United effort with the
team but that's a significant shift in
his
[Applause]
[Music]
favor can just going to keep watch on
Yanik Senna early in the tournament we
were informed that maybe when he arrived
a week ahead of and garos he was hoping
to practice he was in bed had a a
stomach upset a bit of a
[Applause]
virus didn't necessarily bother him but
it was that second round match against
Richard gasg that he got caught they had
some brilliant rallies heavy ball
striking and it was early in the third
set that
CER just had some twinges of cramp and
he got through the match fine
I just wonder about if this becomes an
elongated
match you know when you've been in bed
with a a bit of a bug if you've not
saying that uh I don't I don't believe
he was being vomiting before the
tournament but a bit of diarrhea and
that that you can lose your conditions
in in sometimes in lengthy matches he
hasn't had to play a five set match but
again tension today playing against alra
it's the semi-finals of Roland garos
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
yeah it's it's a it's a fascinating
point there you know in terms of being
pushed having those challenges and
everything else and the conditioning
coming in as you say he's definitely
being put under pressure here now well
well of just I guess trying to find
learn look why the four games have just
gone against him it could be a flat
moment of course players even today the
the great condition that they're in they
can't always maintain this high level
that they put out at the beginning of a
match it might be just a momentary dip
for Center
[Applause]
car front
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
back into this game here as he needs to
talk about the four games in a row
anarth was firmly in front here this is
a look at juice so far where Spaniard
hasn't exactly been
successful then of course with the the
opening set
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
just a couple of uh strikes again he
went a bit closer perhaps to the line
than he liked in the end but the
previous ball which was close to the
line as well I think that was more on
the
line I mean it it is remarkable and and
for those that do play tennis I I think
when you the conventional volley is that
you you come underneath the ball you
don't get as much power as what he just
displayed that drive
volley it's not easy
to complete
[Applause]
he was already walking there cner knew
he' pushed that one
wide and Alara here this is some run we
said similar of sin in the first set he
setting a break down he's now 5-2 up in
the
[Applause]
second well their previous meetings
there have been these sorts of streaks
they've turned into these Classics
talked about their previous match
earlier this year in the uh in the
Californian desert there but a lot of
the other meetings there have been these
are not why they considered such good
matches in the end is they're not 75 S
sixes all the time it's a player who can
go on a run be explosive we saw sinner
out in front in the first set now we're
getting after that early difficulty
alcar responding but it's just all taken
together it engages people the points
they play and Spaniard now very close
here to leveling it
up
Ro Jo themselves there in the plasy
[Applause]
musketeer a beautiful day this match
here getting towards an hour and a half
in could have some way to run so I hope
they got some uh with it warming up got
some sun cream on there well you
wouldn't want to lose your seat would
you no probably don't get it back out
there or on the this
view is
fantastic serving to stay in this second
set having lost the last five games
[Music]
that one's good as
well well it's just a contrast from the
first
set not able to penetrate the defense of
Center was giving plenty of effort
without a doubt from alare he doesn't
know anything less than 100% but he just
wasn't able to get that penetrating shot
in this set Center's level might have
dropped a fraction and alare full
advantage right
[Music]
now lovely angle of the camera view
behind the
court can showing the
direction of the forehand
[Applause]
interesting that we just had that bumper
up on the screen 20 winners for alcar
nine for Senna but the match is not
necessarily right now as hasn't been
dictated by the
winners the first set and two love was
really about the unforced errors that
was coming from the Spaniards end of the
court or even forced errors
[Applause]
the winners have dried up for Center
actually looking at the numbers here
Mark uh from from the opening Set uh for
the Italian
here two in this set as opposed to seven
in the opener that's some drop there as
well saying earlier that alcara is
struggling to hit through a little bit
trying to penetrate the defenses C
finding that a bit more difficult now in
this set
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
even there he's managed to musle that
through but sorts of balls in the first
set he were going for clean
winners tougher going here
[Applause]
look at the uh forc erors as well
breaking down all these numbers as well
from uh alare what he's managed to do
[Applause]
[Applause]
there away and ends the Run of games
against
b h it off very soon
here preparing himself to level this up
perhaps new balls coming into play so a
fresh
Leung frame for both
players it's been tricky with the
tensions as well hasn't it with the with
the changing weather conditions we've
seen that a few times uh with players
going very very quickly when they got
out there onto the match court saying
okay getting the word through send me
out some new ones yeah not just it's
it's been one racket rather than
multiple rackets to change that tension
but to perhaps that might not be as
prevalent or between these guys because
now we've had a few days in these
similar warmer conditions they might
have
found a friendlier tension
[Music]
CH I remember sitz pass with his in his
match with alcar particularly I think it
was after two or three games or
something he was ball was
flying zero he didn't feel like he had
any control on it his general feeling
was playing the Spaniard at the end that
he didn't have much control but yeah he
went sent straight away said yeah can we
um can we sort this out
swing Miss there from
[Applause]
[Applause]
caki Mo there overruling from the chair
com down to check
it yeah you can see the the ball Mark
there majority of
the ball is wide and
it's well will go with Eva's decision as
well bit of a gap between the ball Mark
and the line
[Applause]
tonin
[Applause]
not
up he struggled with his drop shot so
far alcara that maybe was the best one
of the lot there in terms of the weight
of
it really well
played such a high takeback so that adds
to the
disguise takes the the racket back in
the same way if he was going to drive
the 4
man please come under it as that one
more importantly that took a few of the
the bit of the legs out of
[Music]
Center set points here for
alar the
one well everyone waiting for this one
this Marque match up on chatrier Now One
set a piece alar with the second
63 s to begin the third set
[Applause]
[Applause]
again because of that slight dampness
thanks to the the watering that's just
taken place so the the movement is a bit
more assured of both fellas of course
when it starts to dry up you can lose
your footing quite easily
[Applause]
can some
[Applause]
let's for your service
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
against hun
[Applause]
doues were a problem for for sinner as
he surrendered the initiative in that
second set just a bit of
Rhythm let second service
[Music]
it's a let off for sinner
easily being break points there
[Applause]
pick up a little bit a bit of
frustration there with alcara the
previous forehand he missed and then
there cuz he knows here it's five of the
last six games that he's
won There's an opportunity here to carry
on kind of been on his racket on his
forehand there the last couple of points
it's not like sin's gone and rattled
them away reeled off three or four
winners
here just feel like he let the Italian
off there a bit off the
hook first time that I'm trying to think
of whether he has served and fied so far
center it's been very few if he has it
maybe one or two other times but it's
important that he he actually does keep
alcare honest with the
return High fouram volley he was able to
put away so it just keeps alare on his
toes when he's returning
[Music]
can SLE
[Music]
[Applause]
Kenza
[Applause]
[Applause]
P Tim hemman there reach the semis here
didn't he talking of people serving and
volleying
2004
yeah you were talking about Pat rafter
the other day you know doing very very
well here reaching the semis hemman that
year surprised the uh the clay Court
Specialists the uh the baseliners he he
did certainly Henman uh in his prime was
a tough person on clay for the clay
quarters
they knew that if the ball drops short
he's looking very chic isn't he very
he's in Paris
[Applause]
peria just waiting whether he's going to
have a pan Sha
[Applause]
[Applause]
he's just much calmer now here alare as
he takes some instruction there from
Ferrero think of how he was in that
first set was a bit frantic at times but
he's uh he's very settled now and that
clearly presents a big challenge for
this man
[Applause]
Z another double
fault trying to accelerate through on
the juice caught there that second
serve to move it out wide
[Applause]
[Music]
f
Z just taken by what you were saying
earlier about sinner context of his run
through the draw here this is relatively
early in the set but you expect the
bounce back from him a little bit the
one that alcare was able to produce it
hasn't really happened
yet he got through that first service
game of the set but really felt he got
through it due to K's errors rather than
him being outstanding CER you look for
him now as they're both major Champions
both incredible talents but you look for
Ace yeah a bounce from
him don't forget Al kareth was down a
set to love was in a lot of trouble on
that uh particular service game before
he started that momentum shift so is
this the opportunity for cner to bounce
back
we talk a lot about that match with M
where he was all at see first set a bit
but otherwise in his draw gase broke him
back there was a mildly tiest set but
it's still in the end it's a relatively
it's a comfortable win M didn't make it
come for him for a long time to start
but this outside of that is the only
other time in the draw so far I'd
suggest here now this point what
happened in the second set now here
where he's got to come up with an answer
break points
[Applause]
[Applause]
just when he needed
it just the second Ace so t finally
there was a little puff wasn't there of
the uh
line from
that his quickest but very effective
very accurate
[Applause]
[Applause]
another chance here coming for alcaras
Avage
[Applause]
alaras it was relatively easily produced
as well
[Music]
cor immediate correction
there it's kind of early call
it's just flush on the line perhaps
the line's judge was watching the the
ball through the
[Music]
air movement in the crowd
there oh well C well to pick it up and
then alar there the
thread how good was
that first here in the third
well this is a just a spectacular
pass by Carlos alcare to initiate the
first service break I mean it
wasn't just a a bad volley by cner he
had to get down to the ball he had to
also be strong with his wrist to to
absorb the
pace thought he deserved a bit more out
of
that and we've seen that reaction a
couple of times today already G yeah
that smile breaking through as
well to greet it really was a moment of
high quality fitting some senses that it
secured the break of serve as well
so the first big move made in this uh
third set here continuing on his pathway
through here after a difficult bit of a
roadblock to start with their uh caros
alar to this match Yanik sin's
opening since then how he turned it
around in the second set now early in
this third with the first break of the
third set good position for him here
[Applause]
it's a bit of conversation going on
between C and his
team just have a look at those service
games
one it's to be expected really maybe not
so much the numbers are down to that
degree but you would expect the numbers
to be down on where they are in the
tournament because of how good the
opponent is right exactly
we've had eight breaks service breaks in
the match so far here four a piece
now
Z so we say a high level that sin began
the match
with alare couldn't go with him early
Center may be hitting a bit of a wall
and alcar has taken advantage now
building an early break in set
three does alara's level start
to become
fragile is there is there an energy
dipped coming
from the number three seed
[Music]
not suggesting it at the moment with
points like that that pickup from the
service line it's something Mark that
Casper roods talked about as well how
you can he said it's virtually it's
extremely difficult to maintain the
level you can you know as you say
they've played both of them have played
a set more or less of high level but
it's very difficult to maintain that
over over a stretch it is it
is everyone experienced is it but they
masquerade it with the ability to with
behind the serve they can get those
cheap
points tries
to restore their energy
[Applause]
reserves he was so quick to go there
with the second serve actually you
wonder whether he could have pause there
cuz the the ball kid was then he did I
wonder whether that upset cuz the ball
kid was barely off and he was already
delivering that second serve alra
there plays they both do at a you know
good
[Applause]
Pace very good dep accuracy everything
there CL
there's no discussion of the uh the shot
clock in this match can be in some
encounters those two generally just get
on with it
well you posed the
question start of the game here Mark
about this about ALU for a set and a you
know full on bit more than a set you
think from a set and two love down he's
been the the stronger
player this to be another little twist
here another put it full dip perhaps
it's be but it doesn't have to take that
much how closely matched these two are
yeah at this level but you talking maybe
a couple of
percent break back Point here for
cner seizes on it and she would expect
him to he's pumping the fist now there
is that little twist in this third
set garez yeah he's standing on the
there have a look at uh alare I think he
realizes that he's just blowing that
Breo break of serve yes c a quality
return on break point and hit the Final
Four for hand that and our stats will be
a forehand
winner but it came with the double fault
at 15
[Applause]
[Music]
all swept
away a bit of irritation in that the way
he played that point you can even look
at it here that game the first game of
the set that sinner
held that's a game again feel like
alcara could have broken there as well
but it's it's about staying on it isn't
it much easier said than done
[Applause]
[Applause]
K on one for his third Ace
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
F CH at Hunt
[Applause]
spe
BN CER a few times with that as it's
gone on short of for hands sends it out
wide there
133 uh K's on the second serve and if
anything what we're hearing
is what's aided in this dip for
Center is that second serve Pace just
dropping down 5Ks or
more late in the second
set abled for alare to actually have a
good strike at at the return which set
up the
forehand his average second serve speed
through the event generally about 152
153 K in and interesting that he's just
shaking his hands out so it might be
just tension in the forearms could be
the
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
shoulder drop shot again choice of it
there from C he has played that well
[Applause]
[Music]
there is a little bit of cramp here and
a bit of concern the team there a bit of
cramp it's not the first time in the
event with uh with cine you go back to
the match with
gase was early Phil had said of
that he's experiencing a bit of cramp in
it maybe again here well it looks like
now that it's in his left hand one that
he tosses
the ball up
[Applause]
so you can see just trying to release
that tension and yes it did happen with
the against gas gate the same time that
he was also stretching out his calves
now walking away just stretching out his
racket
[Applause]
[Applause]
hand oh
[Applause]
avantage
alaras F and again he's feeling it
perhaps a bit physically here at the
moment as we've been saying sner feeling
it in this service
[Applause]
game do you look a bit
concerned they should be third break
[Applause]
point let second service
struggle to make its way over even for
the
[Music]
[Applause]
L he's done well
there what tooker a hammering in that
point the first serve of yanx Sinner
right into the eye of the which ball
ricocheted a fair distance into the
second row of the stadium
[Applause]
[Applause]
and leashes on that one see know that
become an iconic forehand
really seems to be a little bit Mark I
mean it's really with the serve isn't it
maybe the the fingers with the toss I
mean off the ground it doesn't look as
inconvenient C
case in point
[Applause]
there's double fult and mounting
now four in this set alone this seven
[Applause]
overall I
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
C and
during a 9 minute game on
serve not helping C
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
and certainly pulling the trigger on
that
for just having we're just having a look
at his speeds Mark here as well they are
coming down a little bit just in terms
of what we're tracking here
you know a few kilometers picking up on
this the the serve is where he seems to
be struggling most four kilometers down
on average on this first serve compared
to in the first set where he was how he
started the match was
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
excellent he went to the drop shot very
early not with quite the same conviction
though that he's produced it so many
occasions in this match C alaras going a
bit through the ringer here isn't he in
this game mentally as much as
anything yeah that this is It's of
course it's the physical battle
challenge now but also that mental uh
ability to remain calm try to
just get through this patch this period
whether he can continue to just walk it
off let service
[Music]
[Applause]
that's a lovely Christmas present right
[Applause]
there wow
and of course
alare 12 months
ago same stage semi-finals yes healthy
lead and went into full body
cramp four a here comparative point
there mark you make as you say was
fairing very well well anarath against
jovic worse case of cramp than the case
here perhaps but it's still affecting C
no question his forehand speeds just
carrying three on that are actually up
overall seeing a mixed bag of them in
this
[Applause]
game just a muscle 188
there as zareth missed an opportunity
there 12 minute hold
Center
[Applause]
[Applause]
you see here uh at the moment uh
some treatment for Yanik sinner kind of
expected really with the struggles that
he had he's been having on serve
particularly here in recent times it's
some cramp in the uh in the fingers and
there it's been causing him it does seem
to be it's in in the serve more than
anything because his forehand speeds are
up cracking
it we probably made that decision to
actually go for the
forehand in an effort to finish the
point that's the the the fire power uh
coming off of the the forehand when he
is on song the forehand does a lot of
damage to opponent
[Applause]
[Music]
there it
is and having having seen that last game
probably was a a slow buildup to that
particular moment guy can't help but
think for
alcar just a really poor two games that
he's just put in
[Applause]
oh yeah on the end of a piece of string
there that
time yeah that the last time he served
and it it was an opportunity that went
AR right he he had uh some some space
there to actually put a bit of distance
between he and center and then in that
last game when he was is returning that
was a big Escape for the
Italian and alare now is challenged on
his service
game great Play
points k
[Applause]
[Applause]
a so well done from c not just getting
there but the
response this is the thing from mention
from the spaniard's point of view having
had those chances in what remains a very
tight
matchup last two points he's throwing in
the drop shot alcar it's not the legs
that are cramping on
alcar it's his arms I I would for me I
would be out there trying to keep the
points going
[Music]
[Applause]
ha of course when you throw in the the
Drop shots that there's
no given that you're going to end up
winning the point if if you're drawing
your man in there's a possibility that
they might be able to respond and pick
you off up at
net a wild Miss there on that first
serve that was over the Baseline
[Applause]
oh lunged
[Applause]
across this is amazing that he's now
down a a break point so we we may see
something similar to
the response that he provided after
being a set a breakdown now it's turn
for
sinner to come back we were waiting for
some type of questioning is there going
to be another shift it's happening
[Music]
[Applause]
so convert this time I think the thing
about it as well what you're seeing here
and you made the very good point alcare
of course cramping last year in the
semi-final I mean these are two
incredible athletes make the comparisons
with Nadal jovic and and fedra in that
in that way but this is a huge occasion
still it can do funny things to the body
and and mind you know you've got a 21y
old player a 22y old here this is not a
24 time major Champion against a 22 time
mhm major Champion for
[Applause]
instance and so I think that explains
getting here these kind of es and flows
they've had them in their past matchups
anyway
avantage is the level of this at the
moment as good as some of those previous
matches I mean we'll wait and see the
match isn't done yet but he's the
occasion as well here built it up so
much everyone's been talking about this
they're human
beings as it is it's sner with a another
chance here to extend his run of games
in this third
set now he's calmly done that's a cool
head in that situation alcar
[Applause]
potentially catching Center by surprise
with the Ser volley well break point
down
let second
surface avantage
C it's very my mind at the moment
actually is going back you mentioned
that previous CLE was one of those break
points where alcar sent that back cam
well long look at moments you say like
that that sin's looking to capitalize on
here really rub it
in oh and he has
there he's found a
gap I he's almost in the seats there C
and he still produced The Winner he does
extend that run of games up to three now
thanks to
[Applause]
this yeah there's that composure
of the
[Applause]
Italian and if he can seiz the moment
here big game ahead for the number two
seed this would certainly set the
scene consolidate that break
go chance Z
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
hold chance out
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
ah
[Applause]
he's normally they're both are norly so
secure there you'd expect cner to have
made that I know he's stretching a
little bit but that's
one what it means now just maybe opening
the door a bit for alcara here it's
tense isn't it at the moment here you
see it in the boxes yeah I think
certainly Darren is well aware that this
this game the the level of
importance don't do anything
radical would be the expectation
certainly for sinner
[Applause]
[Music]
you'd almost suggest mark from your
experience it's about trying to it's
just trying to settle back on your
fundamentals you know at this point
there you know you look at sin serve
plus one just go back there because you
can maybe overplay tend to you know
you're so respectful of the opponent try
and do a little bit too much yes I mean
you know in a way keep it simple uh to
try to simplify it if he is experiencing
which maybe have disappeared now because
there's the tension is not
the at the same height but he's going
back to the well which is the forehand
if the serve is not working the forand
still can it doesn't mean to say that he
can't function if he's missing a few
more first
serves hunt his first Ser percentage
it's a couple of points down where it is
on the match but you look at him
and through the event it is a little bit
down on previous rounds I mean he's been
as high as I mean against gas 76 not
always been there but he's well above 60
hasn't really hit that Mark wasn't even
doing that in the first set actually
just under
60 one there well
placed and continuing to make the
running here C in this third set out to
the 5-2 lead
more treatment here in the sit down for
Yanik
sinner this is interesting now here as
well it's the leg there we talked about
uh a match against
gase only able to get that there uh in
the sit down
work very very quickly but anything is
great gratefully received for
sinate he has done an excellent job of
uh in this third set of opening up this
lead because those service games have
not been easy for him throughout the
set to pinch yourself a bit there look
at s if you watch this third set that
he's leading 52 when you think of a lot
of the points that we see
so here we are uh 2 hours 20 minutes in
Yanik sinner in a good spot
perhaps to go on here and retake the
lead in sets in this
one just a little bit more treatment for
the
uh right leg a rub down in the in the
sit down Center
[Music]
caros alar here trying to respond really
he made the point a couple of times is
let this set to this point get away from
him yeah a a little different for for me
the way I'm reading this match
that alare really ignited his game when
he was down a set and a break wasn't
because of
sin's uh uh dip I mean it was a small
dip but it it alare certainly started
to rise to the
challenge but this change up for me has
been about alare really
[Applause]
donating last three games more or less
four games
[Applause]
[Applause]
T to tense
[Applause]
yeah he made up his mind very early
there C to go after that conter
[Applause]
[Applause]
part of what makes him so good I mean
all the best all the Champions so good
is their ability to of course Sense on
opponent's weakness seiz on moments of
hesitation from the opponent often we've
talked about how good CER is on break
points trying to set another one up
there the execution there that time
oh
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
there body language there suggesting he
feels like he's got some life here in
this
set if you look at sin service games in
the set you can understand that
[Applause]
[Applause]
so clearly now there's some
tension for Center aiming to go up two
sets to one by holding here so we'll
just see how his body
reacts got these new balls to help him
as well bit more Pace perhaps there
[Applause]
[Applause]
Z the most assured start tring to serve
out this set from C
[Applause]
[Music]
struggling in that department five from
17 three from 11 those numbers both
below 30% in the second
serve so important here a pace taken off
there they allowed him to get forward
control the point Center
[Applause]
[Applause]
he
well I don't want to be overly critical
of of alcar but I I'm it's being a bit
slow to kind of impose himself through
this juncture he's playing against a an
individual right now who's not
serving the the big bombs off the first
serve the second serve has the pace has
been reduced alare has yet to change his
court position to return
[Applause]
serve and but seeing a number of the
returns now Landing short they're just
sitting in the Wheelhouse for C to
continue to have a a rip at the
forehand finds open territory with that
first
serve Center and it's been a wonderful
bounce back from the double fault in the
first point set points
[Applause]
turns to his team there that's an
excellent result for Yanik sinner there
had to struggle his way through that set
but he's found the goods 63 takes
[Applause]
it oh
look as you as you were just even you
know speaking there guy couldn't help
but my mind going back to the Australian
Open and sometimes it's the past that
can raise its head
[Applause]
um alare gets medv meddev has just
absolutely fought just CED his way
crawled his way into their matchup
believe it was the quarterfinals Maybe
finals um but medev was just absolutely
exhausted everyone was wondering what's
the type of game that meddev will come
out with this will be should be one-way
traffic for alarv has youth on his
side alcarez was the one that came out
and just tried to rip every single ball
just tried to out hit a big hitter in
meddev but the points were kept short it
played into the hands of meddev meddev
ended up winning that match four
sets alare was down two sets to love
very
[Music]
quick so I'm only re relaying that now
because I feel it's relevant that the
the tactics of alarab in that third set
he's looking up the other end and he
sees an aing opponent but he goes back
into keeping the point short drop
shotted served and voled I felt like
that was all
unnecessary keep the point going make
your opponent
hurt
pin yeah and he's look he's an
unbelievable player but I think it's
something it relates to a point you've
made I forget the round but uh you said
that sometimes it's that flip side of
that exuberance sometimes and the
ability to play every shot and be
explosive that sometimes can just go a
little bit
early produces that one and right it
round right on the line C wants ever
aaki more down just to have a look it's
worth a
check oh okay it didn't take
long kind of sitting on that line from
our commentary booth and maybe one of
those that major the ball is
out you only have a fraction that's
kissing the
[Applause]
[Music]
line fif a for alar
meanwhile fourth here with that hold
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
see how Yanik sin continues to get on on
serve here terms of the match
mid-50s percentage said he's uh a bit
lower than he would have liked at this
point what he's been doing in the
[Music]
tournament has been effective uh Landing
the first serve behind it I mean he's up
at three quarters that you know in terms
of the points he's won so far in the
match very similar numbers to the
tournament both of them down in second
serve point
one he's looking to you often use that
word masking it you know hiding he
struggling behind the second serve well
don't show as many of them
[Music]
yep Z
just thinking we've seen them both
already here watching on Mary piss year
2000 one of goar's titles that same year
overall so winning two
Champions together there from that year
[Applause]
s brings out the uh the quality there
talk about that forehand side where he
struggled Mark he's been feeling it a
bit but uh the forehand remains
devastating yeah
he sighted that ball early enough and
didn't go laterally
out forced into the doubles alley
actually went out on that V just to cut
the angle off and enhance his
opportunity to create the angle
[Applause]
much reaction from alcar
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
that so a bit of verbal interaction
there and nothing to be overly alarmed
about it's all positive I'm
sure but they might be just sensing that
yanic you know just trying to avoid a
dip in his level
[Music]
[Applause]
h z hands
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh well he got him in cner doing well
actually to connect with the one that
was over his head he was nowhere for the
followup well look this is risky not the
drop shot but it's this one to play a
backend Top Spin lob and you're inside
the
Baseline I think that's what shines out
is
[Applause]
[Music]
youth
P just ahead in the Ace count again six
there It's Tricky isn't it though I mean
I guess for Han Carlos as well working
with alare because you got this amazing
talent you don't want to take that back
too much but you've been just suggesting
just in a couple of
moments the shot selections could be
different
mhm and of course sitting up here from
the booth looks
[Music]
[Applause]
different he's looking down at the
surface there alare spot anything to be
too bad a bounce or anything
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
there he was just outplayed the quality
of
cner and this is maybe what the the team
of cner were asking for just for him to
be a bit more Brave with the
forehand he had a crack it that
return
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
center his feeling is generally on point
and again it was
there to get out of that service game
[Applause]
two1 he can play all the shots uh Carlos
alcara we look back at that previous uh
game here here was another one which um
you just don't see too many players that
one
yeah I mean
I I've seen players try
that off of the volley that when they
come under it a traditional volley but
certainly not a
drive to handed coming over the top of
it ends up winning the point he
certainly stretched out the
[Music]
Italian r
[Applause]
[Applause]
up here to two and 3/4 hours in in this
one early in this fourth
set first break of serve here sinner in
charge
love game last time around on serve the
siner come back to a point you know we
were we were saying at the outset Mark
about these two that they do
hence really really tight previous
matches and they've split all of them
they do an awful lot of things
incredibly well but it's just that again
over the course sinner if he's healthy
and everything stays with that maybe
just in his style a little bit more
steady on this surface alcar a bit more
as you've been
analyzing more explosive a bit more
Mercurial with a cner over the stretch
here just going to that's going to see
him
through yep it certainly could play out
that way
and one never knows if this uh does go
to a a fifth set and it becomes an art
wrestle does becomes if it's an arm
wrestle it's a physical
battle does
Yanik trust himself given
uh the week before he was struck down
with uh a a little virus that uh sent
him to bed for a day or
two car l
and yet
we have never spoken about the the
physical the lack of physical attributes
for alare and then last year it happened
quickly with his how he would bounce
back
[Applause]
part
[Applause]
L
zero Motors the forehand
alra did extremely well to actually make
him play one more ball but the center
backand into the Open
Court not by
much the ball was there k
looking to take it on again as she
suggested his team have been looking for
him to do especially on the forehand
Center go after it little bit
[Music]
more interesting that there's not much
coming from Ferrero at this stage over
the
last since the beginning of this set
it's it's been
more coming from the manager
[Applause]
r
[Applause]
[Music]
PK both
teams just that extra interaction
verbally this is delicately balanced
right
now a little surge by over play
it one could secure the set and we play
a fifth and a surge from C can secure
the
[Applause]
match kept his wits about him there and
sin tested
him
caran yeah unfortunately for Yanik
not able to put the brakes on as he
chased that forehand to be able to
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
recover kisses that
sideline
very audible about it as well alar leads
again in the
[Music]
[Applause]
43-2 it's an intriguing uh period of
this one that difference as you were
saying between uh C wrapping it up
perhaps in four or going all the way as
they've done before as to rule out
either favor either over the other at
the moment even with sinner further in
you know in front here two sets to one
up a look at Al's winner profile for the
match here he's doing through the
forehand side
and looking at C there bit more
balanced numbers
[Applause]
overall not quite as many winners of
course there
[Music]
[Applause]
well it's quite a day and this uh
semi-final ongoing
here turning into possibly into quite a
match not quite there yet Perhaps here
Midway through the fourth but still has
that potential to well and truly
ignite yeah both players
just forcing these blows it's almost
like in in the uh the stomach region
[Applause]
oh can zil
[Applause]
[Applause]
and we see
alare almost half the
distance
closer that is a noticeable change but
then now back on the the second there
going back towards the uh basically the
distance he's occupied
throughout but I mean that's interesting
I mean even he is going back and it's a
very very deep make the ball on the
second serve on the return at least
that's what you were suggesting there's
a bit of bit of change overall because
the the return position's been constant
throughout first and second
ball uh yeah but that change should have
actually happened in the a set ago
yeah sometimes you forget to look down
the other end that net seems to be a lot
higher
[Applause]
oh no I mean his previous ball was
excellent how he spotted the opportunity
redirected but he couldn't capitalize on
it
[Applause]
alarra so when he's made contact there
guy
his weight isn't going into the overhead
he he's kind of at the the point of the
ball coming down on top of
him please believe that if you can get
that extra body weight going towards the
target you're only enhancing your
chances oh oh superb just hearing alar
out there sliding on this chatrier clay
expertly and he's offed just to tellw
himself down there at least dry his hand
at alare but it is Sinner's turn to
actually take more time wasn't a a
lengthy point but s's been going
offre is back ready to play Center has
just
arrived is is this maybe the the time
the chance oh that's a great
serve
timely she pulls out the carrot she been
carrying that in her bag she just whips
it out now
[Applause]
yeah he seized it there by the Scruff of
the neck from 30 all CER that's
impressive
[Applause]
just as we were suggesting because that
moment for alcara there to go on get the
break could now be
Sinner's opportunity to
Surge yeah and these moments are key
players they tend to
recognize they're going to make that
surge simplify it they use their weapons
let's see if the forehand starts to
crank up from
[Applause]
C St stung him with the pass the first
one good volley from cner but he was in
[Applause]
trouble oh yeah that guy did a great job
didn't he by getting the first backhand
below the level of the
[Applause]
net yeah I feel like now alar is even
exploring standing wider on that
a sprinkling of occasions throughout the
tournament has he done so I mean have a
look how high that ball jumped on
cner he's way off the
court let service
[Applause]
you
see just seem to just seem to get a
little bit lost with his bearings so it
didn't have the commitment to that
volley then don't try the most
spectacular volley if there's any
hesitation I feel like because he
bungled the volley he's showing oh was
it was it going long was there the wind
or the
sun just a poor shot selection
[Applause]
[Laughter]
oh there's a shot selection you don't
say well he didn't have time to really
no make a decision and it just happened
automatically but that's when he's at
his Mercurial best here Carlos alar I
mean look at
that it's bordering on ridiculous isn't
it what he can do here absolutely at
full
stretch and it had to be a
winner because he was out of the Court
there was no way he was coming back in
to play the next one if CER had a volley
[Applause]
alar as pumped up as he has been alcar
so far
here once again 4-3 in the
[Applause]
fourth yeah it's just just threatening
this one now to go up we've seen siners
forehand and then we saw this one an
ultimate Point
here of caros alar his forand there that
was incredible 140
K yeah wanting to hear it from the
crowd and that game could have been
entirely different had he not won that
point and that it could be a bit of a a
set Turner break of serve creator
at the crowd on the change of ends
they're starting to do the Mexican wave
so there might be a bit of feeling
charged up in this match
[Applause]
now three hours in here Yanik sner
service game you feel coming up CU caros
alcar what he managed to do in that
previous game maybe we'll give him a a
bit of a boost a bit of a
platform perhaps go on and break the
Italian serve
[Applause]
here to wait here for the moment for the
uh crowd to stop with this
wave s here serving again
[Applause]
34 oh
after what had happened particularly at
the end of the previous game that's
that's good from sin finds the first
serve clemont in the
green enjoying this match alongside of
manso barami
[Applause]
after those magical that magical moment
the previous game from Alara here sin is
looking to respond in his
style yeah well it's it's indicative
isn't it you in order to
win a match or the in these moments it's
going to be your
strengths your weaknesses don't win a
match so he's going
to what has elevated him to number one
center now he goes to the drop shot it's
a fine effect there
outright yeah it's the repeatability
isn't it again there it's the shots you
trust most that you go back to your
biggest shots in the biggest
moments they both prospered with the
drop shot so far in this tournament as
mentioned previously C just as much
actually on the numbers as uh as alcar
is known for the Drop shots but uh sin
has really used it well in this run
through the draw
High numbers of drop shot winners every
[Applause]
[Music]
round Al threaten there with the nature
of his whole previously C just says hold
on put in a love
game and what that does
[Applause]
is provide a the platform in this next
one they take it slight
pause fresh rackets coming
out but he just hasn't made the the
lengthy investment in holding that last
service
game very quick decisive for or concise
for
Senna and uh I have a
feeling he might have put in a request
for something there either as
Zaki communicating that back to the rest
of the tournament
staff set of new balls coming into play
here
[Applause]
[Music]
string that foram well alar again
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
ch
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thumps that away
alar he really is trying to thump his
way through this pump himself up further
what he was trying to do at the end of
his previous service game and sin
quelled
him corner to
corner these are the moments again that
you go back to something that you
reliability that you can do repeat
business
[Applause]
with oh
yeah another one of those crowd pleases
and his points that he plays they don't
they both do
so there's that using the geography of
the Court stretching Center to the
[Applause]
max your service
wa pleas
[Music]
it's just been paused
here let's wait a minute to see if we're
going to do anything sure come
[Applause]
okay just an incident in the uh in the
crowd here soaky Moore has paused the
play here so the players are going to
the bench to send somebody and Hope hope
yeah they going to send
somebody bad thing is we can't give them
water told here that it's uh it's one of
the spectators just to the left of our
down from our commentary position he's
um feeling a bit unwell we believe
that's the reason for the
pause players here obviously will be
held for the moment so can get some uh
further update
here they say good yeah they say it's
good alar was actually just getting a
message I
think chatting over to him from the
crowd in that section of the Court there
saying it was he was okay looks like
they can
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
continue unfortunately but just the
positioning of where it's happening it
is that the the back of the Court could
be in the eyesight of
alar play they said they're okay okay
saying it's okay okay up there now but
as you say markk they've got to be
absolutely sure because be in the
eyeline thumbs up there then looks like
we can resume now here down in that area
the court looks there progression there
AR resuming of course game points
nothing obviously that could be done
with what what's going had to pause but
uh obviously it is a pause in the middle
of the game an unnatural
pause just some movement there in the uh
in the crowd where that incident
happened right now the players have
obviously got to try and do their best
here to
refocus still another game point
alar has managed to do that on the
second game
[Applause]
point edges in front again here back
into this fourth set the
Spaniard 54 up
[Applause]
you always tricky that of course uh it
Happ you know ultimately happens and we
hope uh spectator feeling on well is is
feeling starting to feel a little bit
better there
now but either side of that alcar
getting himself in this position back
into this fourth set to uh perhaps now
try and put some more pressure he
couldn't do it he hasn't been able to do
it Hest through this set looking at
sin's numbers overall in the set he's
only won three points of his serve but
whether he can apply that score ball
pressure
now and uh look to take this match into
a
[Applause]
decid r
so he's been very good we talked about
the the third set we wondered whether
Yanik sner how he how he won that set to
be honest with the struggles on serve 63
in this set he's been very secure so far
he's only lost the three points on serve
yeah maybe that Focus has been taking
care of his end of the Court first which
then might there might be some opening
so
he's followed maybe that plan
maybe he has definitively followed that
plan he's got to do it couple more times
potentially in this
set it has actually been it's been a
server server set so far I mention he's
lost three
points Al has lost seven overall no-
break points in the set so far and again
for Point going the way of the server
[Applause]
here I think at times they both
fluctuated a bit struggled on serve
across the first three sets and this set
been a different story so far
anyway it's well placed as well deep
[Music]
[Applause]
he it's a reaction to the court position
of alare to return the serve he is
standing
closer first
serve go into the body crowd your
opponent
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
well cner didn't do a lot wrong to be
honest with the approach but alcar is
ability here to produce these moments
really engages the crowds wherever he
goes
hallah and on the Run
hasn't slid into the ball and stopped at
contact still on the run and amazing
control I mean we saw Manel barami there
he'd be proud of that one one that hung
up
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh no no
no rush your blood there a little bit
with with sinner again it was an
excellent approach looked to have set
him up to do enough to win the point
that time
and
whoa a look at how he's done in this
semi-final at this point in a game at 30
all these pressure points as we call
them nine from
15 certainly been dominating from there
cner cner reverting back to his original
position on this point
[Applause]
[Music]
oh so good to see these great Champions
and what they can do sin has done this
at points now Alara there brings up the
set point takes it
on just does a little bit more senses
the
moment is he about to take this all the
way now has to make a
decision yep there the direction is to
go back Al karath
[Applause]
following this is a
first break point of the entire set it's
more than that of course
[Applause]
[Music]
yeah he's got him
there the chatrier crowd show their
appreciation for that effort from the
Spaniard he's hit back again
here for a second time on cner and these
two great Rivals are Going the Distance
just taking on a bit of extra
refreshment here he suggested Marky will
be uh getting this final set
underway trailed in sets on two
occasions fought back twice to set this
up there two great Rivals as they've
already
become current Grand Slam champions
both going for a maiden Roland gal final
appearance and it all comes down to this
deciding set McCree still alongside Mark
Woodford taking you through this alare
here to begin the
[Music]
[Applause]
decider it really is fitting though
these two gladiators
the future of men's
tennis at the top of the the mountain
right now but I mean we wouldn't expect
anything less five setep
match it does feel fitting in a way
where they're at right now as we've said
it's been up and down in the as it often
is over a five Setter but yeah something
fitting about
it now I suppose the neutrals here this
amazing crowd here again phip chat hope
that they can both play their best
tennis at the same time against each
other then it would be we are in for
quite a fun set then with what these two
can produce we know they can and they
have done it times here it's just about
whether they could do it at the same
time
really take each other
[Applause]
on who's going to be the stronger here I
mean Chan kind of sin but you you know
looked at it you look at all the numbers
even at this point you look at the match
how it's been there's very little you
know in terms of a decisive case that
you can make mention coming into this
very similar times
spent on uh on cour coming in no
question that alcara is leading in terms
of the momentum here right now into that
last set start of
[Applause]
this car
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
nicely done Al Builds on winning that
fourth set with a confident hold to
begin the decider alar
[Music]
[Applause]
you do wonder if you suggested Mark at
the the beginning of this set whether
that serving First Advantage I because
it's likely to be very very tight is
that ability just get your noise in
front every time hold on could that be
decisive for him can sinner turn this
round led by a set
twice yeah I think two factors that
that lean towards one is that serving
first still say that over F in a five
set match just having that
Advantage is can be significant the
other is
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh
no C been probing away arly dictating
that
point staying in it
well and that's a takes a toll that
first point ball striking of cner was at
a premium there missed on the final
backand a bit of a distance there but I
think he's taking on air and that's what
I maybe leaning towards as well I just
if C has been
[Music]
with a viral issue before the tournament
sure he's played to his way to this
stage but he hasn't been caught in a
long lengthy
match with the amount of of tension that
is present
[Applause]
light
move by the
[Music]
[Applause]
Italian well timed that's what you're
searching for a volley that's
around the hide of your belly
button let's
see and in response that it's Alara that
has decided to come a little closer for
this first point
goes back uh ear a match where he had a
position there and then sent backhand
return second serve very very
long just those moments that will give
sinner hope here he can
steady that run of points that alar was
on breaking and then holding to begin
the decider
[Applause]
[Music]
no he can't get there again he's got the
the lob on lock
alar tremendous feeling what to quickly
throw this in this was a a a heavy clean
ball striking rally until
then unfortunately for Yanik as he tried
to recover actually went a
further around and just could not get to
that next shot it was over his head
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
nowz baiting y center there sure it
[Applause]
was caught there by the cameras that he
was showing nothing but a forehead with
that returner
serve early chance here for the Spaniard
final set great point
[Applause]
[Applause]
gutsy it
was I know they're both they both like
to go to the drop shot but there at
break
point you have to have that velvet Pair
of Hands
[Applause]
just have the
calmness to
recognize that alarv was moving
laterally only out of the
corner we get drop shot
[Applause]
[Applause]
yeah he likes it I think we all
did it's just ability there you've got
so little space really to go into and
the execution this is this is
brilliant well I can guarantee you
there's one person that that's not happy
with this that is Cent Up
thought he might have got
something on the
volley that's just rude by alare to make
that second break point of the
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
game oh wow just raises the bar when he
needs to there a couple of points from
Carlos alar there carries on from taking
this into a fifth with an early break in
the decider
[Applause]
now well the smallest of margins must
have been kissing the
Baseline yeah that previous ball the
finish the one yeah you're right I
think and of course you you have to
pause you want to look down if you're a
center you want to see you're hoping
that it's called out or that it's
missing
and slight delay opens the door for
[Music]
alcar stopped
here this
time actually stopped the play there as
well that's why he
did got the
point there's confirmation of
it turn over
[Music]
definitely some momentum about this
sprinkled in of course these moments of
magic that caros alare can produce but
so much
solid Play Just Like That keeping it
simple
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
now sinner there rapid up to that drop
shot and with the feather-like contact
that they've both had hard ch in
abundance here maybe the most impressive
aspect of both of their games that
through this through this three and a
half hours now quality of their Drop
shots and counter drops
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
for
for wondered about that the footwork
from alcara there on that PO he was so
Keen to take it on the
forehand quite as steady as he he
usually is
C may be sensing something
here let
[Music]
service fairest of margins
[Music]
super Point super super
Point again his ability
guy major point pressure point
and this back hand he pulls it up the
[Applause]
line I think s was expecting maybe the
drop shot into at least the ad Court see
his weight started heading that
direction
GRE
[Music]
gutsy wow 2613 that is a waited
the touch as well no mistake
there he's riding here right now the
Spaniard five games in a row in
Commander the
deciding
[Applause]
Zig Yep this is the the final point
bre definitely places that
forehand it's a a winning shot so
guy I I have it it written down the to
break surf from 30 all the last game
receiving game alare two winners at 30
all just in that game on serve two
winners
[Applause]
just takes it out of the hands of the
[Applause]
opponent he's LED twice by a set here
but Yanik sner is in big difficulty
now massive game coming up here he's not
got the uh the best of Fifth set records
in his career one six lost seven one all
here alar far superior you know we look
around for possibly here he is to decide
this because it's so much on a knife
edge in so many respects if you said
maybe that's something love three
here down in this decider I think C
desperately needs to end this run of
five straight games for alarab
[Applause]
his
record it's only his second five ceries
played here he had that one a couple of
years ago with uh his compatriot Ramos
vgas four and a half
hours see the center picture Shi
the president of the French tennis
Federation but his record overall in
fifth set sarath is superb
9-1 his
favor Z that one loss was at the
Australian Open again a couple of years
ago to
[Applause]
[Music]
bartini as you said Mark it's you look
at the last two games they've both been
tight both been at 30 all and it's the
man who can come up with that bit of
extra quality really sees it and that's
been him in both
cases complimented sinner so much how he
plays the big points well but it's been
his opponent those last couple of games
who've done that 30 all each
[Applause]
time s forward again there as
well
CL wor
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I wasn't one of his best Drop shots Al
had a little bit more depth on it but
uh still comes out on top
sure
does not able to get enough on that
[Applause]
ball okay he's done it the last two
games from this juncture with two
winning
shots the number three SE
[Applause]
[Music]
needed that the forehand fires
J to say that too often from his point
of view in the last few
minutes well it's a winner this time is
from the Italians end of the Court
[Applause]
been comfortably outdone and as we've
shown you before in the forehand winners
as
well but this time from 30 all sin steps
up just when you were maybe you're
thinking
questioning the uh Australian Open
Champion he's the one to deliver on the
board in the decider
[Applause]
[Music]
mer see Mam and
[Applause]
[Music]
oh he's G and produce that
Sinners threatening to soore here now to
Surge with moments like
that some smaller steps little Shuffle
to help create that strong base and Shad
the backand up the
line and it's got to be you look at that
corner there AR the that's a postage
stamp basically not far more than that
and he's gone and hit it yeah he's
licked it
there
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
f is threatening to get really good now
Z he's turning
into mini Surge from sin here the way
that he held how he held from 30 all and
now this
[Applause]
[Applause]
just a a slight nod hoping that his
charge can remain
disciplined
maintain this one set one break
advantage
[Applause]
[Applause]
oh I guessed he was across there
c p it's a sign of it isn't it that I
mean every game here is going 30
all on a run aren't
[Applause]
we maybe the first game might have
that's the only one that I have down
that hasn't gone to 30 all
[Applause]
three games now this one fourth
consecutive game
[Applause]
[Applause]
still an amazingly positive attitude for
Yanik sna it's
what Kell expects of the people the
players that he works with in these
moments you got to help
yourself body language is still positive
for cner from what he's gone through in
this match with the cramps
flies from alcar
there out of this game
yet this track record absolutely
outstanding if you think of the number
of players C is going to rise to number
one we all lose this number of players
has coached to the top ranking he's
brought to them their games and above
all their mentality as
well that's going to be the biggest
thing Above All in This final set the
mental strength of both being tested
here
[Music]
[Applause]
hands on hips did slip a little bit but
the um drop shot again was so well
executed from this
[Applause]
man and the
[Applause]
touch it is walking a fine line
[Music]
juce
again three errors from alare in this
game that he's tried to P the
trigger wanting his power ball striking
to see him through this game
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
no I should be saying
yes
but they
are I'm Cloud glad to hear the crowd
supportive of
that Exquisite
shot incredibly
Brave now he always is he always takes
it on
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
eventually through that service game the
Spaniard holding on to the advantage
here the break advantage in this
deciding set alcar over Center
[Applause]
4-1 he really does play his uh
tennis he
uh you know really really engaging way
aggressive way and uh Brave way to be
honest you look at that ball that he put
out of the air for the winner in the uh
what was it the penultimate point of the
last game G very very risky risky and
and and brave but he is willing to put
himself on the line I think that's what
is as you said it just it captures the
the essence of alare he's willing to run
the risk but he's also prepared if he
ends up in second place he will go out
playing that
[Applause]
way close there every there short medium
and longer length
[Applause]
I well as always between these two it
seems you can't take your eyes off this
3 hours and 49 minutes Carlos alar might
have the edge here on Yanik sner but
it's not decisive as of yet miss it's
only one break s here though one for
down serving
again oh
[Applause]
now kth back to this positive
position closer to the Baseline
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
jamed with the direction of that second
serve the effect that alare is trying to
create for himself is much like s
throughout the tournament has taken on
opponent's second serve inside the
Baseline it gets the ball back the other
end takes time away from the
opponent car under 200 there hitting the
spot there for
cner f
[Applause]
a doesn't even make the net from alcar
and S straightforward
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
hold still get the feeling here and at
this point there's a little way to
run just the previous history of these
two
current major Champions matches they've
produced
[Music]
he will have a way to run if cner can
produce moments like that first
class
[Music]
Z and there's that
stop
as for Center being able to recover
think of the thick snow and then change
the
direction around another gate
[Applause]
[Applause]
they've added of course uh as we said
many times you know in his rise they've
added a lot of muscle as well to him but
still got that as you say that
background that ability
those legs as well the joints CU he's
been doing it since he was a
kid excellent skiing prowess that he's
had helped him there as you say a couple
of points
ago short angle alare anticipated
it and the
speed of the 21y old
it's a mishit return but he doesn't wait
for the ball to come to
him still has enough energy to cut the
angle off just thump it up the
[Applause]
line caran
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
CH let service
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
you mentioned ju colis Ferrero through
the match sometimes it's been more vocal
other times it's been more quiet now at
the moment here because at that
end there a lot coming from him between
[Applause]
points no not quite enough from alcara
that time he has done cner on a number
of
occasions can't get the elevation there
cner coming back into this game now
y of course it's the
geography of
the the alare is trying to uh
utilize just didn't connect with the
attempted
[Applause]
LOB
aage alaras
feel for that cheaper point I'm
sure purchase with that
[Applause]
serve so his first serve percentage
little bit down today and right through
the match as well actually these
percentages have been really high once
in the
tournament it's still
good and a couple of them there
squeak
through that service game alar here a
game away from the
final yeah his first serve percentage
actually still very good overall I mean
it's 65% for the match but it's just
been a little bit down over the course
it's about when you find it when you
produce it he did it there those last
couple of points in particular
to put the pressure back on C here this
is a look just backing up what we've
been saying here alcar on average
Tournament
72% down on that and sin for that matter
as well down today and and maybe that
comes with the the semi-finals of Roland
Goos and the respect that they have for
each
[Applause]
other Ro
[Applause]
[Applause]
there this uh really intriguing contest
here which is c for four hours of play
here on chatrier is it coming to an
end Yanik sin here going to be
denied being as he would do if he could
turn this round becoming just the third
first time major champion in the open
era to reach Le the final of the
following major event it's been done too
often you think of been winning the
Australian Open that first title at
Grand Slam
level still be maintaining hopes here
two5
down CH Z
[Applause]
you know yourself Mark you've been in
this position obviously in your career
so many times in this situation 251
break down you just have to break it
down exactly you focus on the one break
just hold serve here take care of your
end and then you never
know a few times in the match
Touch of occasions where s has been in
that position with the off forand
approach and it's not ended up winning
the
point could be that put down to the the
data that they provided on each
other there might be a preference for
that information given to alcar that c
likes that shorter off forand Direction
[Applause]
t k showing the ability to fight back on
multiple occasions talk about the
Australian Open you know how he came
back as well in that
final C might be barking at the
challenge here of being
25 say just the one break
[Music]
Hunkin
[Applause]
car fun
[Applause]
[Applause]
does do the first part of the job from
his point of
view alar
can now break Alara here and keep this
alive will it be the spaniel who moves
through to the final here for the first
time if if
Yanik is feeling some
tension he just has to look down the
other end if it's a applicable for him
looks the same for alare as he steps up
to serve
serving for a spot in the final then the
first time here Carlos Alara
53 and the decider
[Applause]
[Applause]
accurate with the forehand
[Music]
[Applause]
10 or is it simply braveness
[Applause]
[Applause]
SE yeah as he got it he's very quickly
onto it there
cner yeah accepted by alcar
there can saw that drop shot so quickly
the
Italian he
[Applause]
[Music]
did K having seen that winner from
cner this is a high equality serve of
his
own instead of a center winner we have a
alare
[Applause]
[Applause]
almost there was no holding back there
at all the position he's in CER he went
at that double hander as hard as he's
gone at anything in these 4 hours and 5
minutes hasn't half held back on the the
two
backhands it's what makes these two so
good as well in that respect they both
step
up in those key moments
great serve
again does alare focus on wide and wide
extract your man further off the court
so the next shot you have you
potentially have the Open Court Ferrero
wanted him to the end last time to do
that he didn't really manage it as he go
there this time as you
suggest first match point here for the
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
again it's cner to be fair I mean
stepping up Match Point down
there every ball was
redlined it's a serve that has kept
alare alive in this game
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
wi again not an ace this time third time
that direction is paid off for alcara to
the G Court in
succession oh
mom having a tough time watching the
conclusion of this
181 km second serve
[Applause]
second match
[Applause]
point the few there who couldn't look
either around the crowd as alar failed
to make that
tense all
[Applause]
round say his dad looks one of the karma
out
there
alaras big time serve again to that
juice Court sent
in that that's maybe where the payoff is
sliding It Wide to the center
forehand oh is this going to be into the
body you
think it seems so
he has done it this time caros Alara is
into the ringos final for the first
time these two always play drawn out
compelling superb
Encounters this one sits in there again
the full five sets required sin led by a
set on two occasions but it's the
Spaniard who
prevails he's always talked about this
about getting to the final here what a
big ambition it was for him to go on and
try and match what his coach did and
lift the C de musketeer and he's going
to get the chance to do that now Al
karath after this amazing
success 4 hours in 9 Minutes twice from
a set down he wins 63 over cner in the
decider gee he gave it everything the
Italian and it takes something special
from Carlos alar
today able to keep composed after being
outplayed in the early stages uh
couldn't find his
game a set in a
break before igniting the Jets and in
particular What a Mighty game that
service game at 5-3 the amount of times
that he was able to find the corner with
the first serve the second serve packed
some
punch and the celebration
in the box
of
alar yeah he could well match his
coach's achievement here
now win this tournament for the first
time some effort there because he was
playing catchup for large Parts you
mention how difficult the start was for
him that first said or so as Sin saw
early
on then Italian going back in
[Music]
let here from alar now speaking to Alex
ker
Carlos you just reach your first Rand
garos final suffering struggling
fighting but on top of everything with
great attitude from you and from Janik
how did you learn to win this match
because you always try to enjoy and to
have fun and today it was all about
suffering you have to find uh the joy
suffering that's the I think that's the
that's the key uh even more here on on
Clay here in ranga Ros uh
long rallies four hours matches five
sets you have to fight you have to
suffer but uh as uh I tght to to my team
many many times you have to enjoy
suffering was this one of the toughest
match you ever played uh probably
probably uh the toughest matches that
I've played in my short
career uh has been against Janik uh the
US Open 2022 this one that means uh the
great player that the Janik is uh uh the
the team that he he has as well the
great work he put uh every day and I
hope to to play many many more uh
matches like like this one against
Johnny but uh yes one of the toughest
matches that I've played for
sure they have to play next so we have
to move on but the beginning janic was
playing unbelievable tennis you didn't
find your Rhythm and once you find your
Rhythm and you played very well the
third set was a little bit weird for
everyone because you were struggling
Janik was struggling I I'm not so sure
what happened if you want to share with
us or if you saw also Janik having
problems yeah I saw I saw him struggling
a little bit but uh yeah I
uh uh I was uh crumping uh Janik as well
in the third set so we we had to to
fight you know I uh I learned from uh
last year match against jovic that I was
in the same position like like today but
uh uh I know that that in this moment
you have to to be C you have to H keep
going because the crown is uh is going
to uh go away you know and uh you have
to uh stay there fighting uh trying to
uh make short of the the points uh but
yeah it was uh it was a little weird
let's say the third set but uh you I I
think the fourth set and the five set it
was a really good match uh great points
uh great uh tennis uh and uh I'm really
happy about uh everything uh that I've
done today uh waiting for my moments uh
until the the last moment that I that I
took
it we have to finish
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
and
