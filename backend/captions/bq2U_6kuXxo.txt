against 10 for a place in the third
round course Eric comes from Rich
coaching
stock it's very much in the DNA his dad
was a standout coach at the University
of Georgia the Bulldogs for many many
years Ken Ken on the left my good friend
out yep proud to call Kent caner a
friend good to have him back in
Australia it's been a couple of years a
good very good player on his own right
on the left there yeah that's he's a big
boy Ken he in his time he was one of the
tallest wasn't he y these days I'm not
so sure if he'd hold that mantle they
seem to be getting
bigger and that was Eric just to his
right yeah that's who to his to his left
to our right if we're looking at the
screen excuse me yeah
do you think we need to settle in Robbie
is it too early to suggest that because
it looks like there's going to be a few
few of those yeah no
kidding one of tian's greatest strengths
is that he doesn't give away too many
free points you don't win 28 matches in
a row from Futures and through
Challenger level if you make unforced
eras three Futures two
challenges plus a semi-final in the
third Challenger that's what constituted
that 28 win streak from late in May till
the middle of
July out that's the best way to get
confidence in a rally like that but what
I'm really meaning is winning all those
matches back to back that will just
boost your confidence
immeasurably you start believing you can
play against players of a higher ranking
then
out good start for the American a
confident start speaking of confident
Americans now's a good time to throw
down to our good friend Nick Monro who
is C side thanks for joining us Nick
Robie and Fitzy thanks for having me man
it's uh always fun to be on a call with
you guys and these guys have already as
you said Fitzy settled in in this first
game and you know you talk about
confidence you you all have been talking
about the amount of matches that
learnard Tien has won you know when he
walked on this court I just felt a sense
of confidence within him and you know I
think a lot of that had to go to his
preseason training he was training in
Carson California at the USA facility
with Taylor frit uh Alex mikkelson
Marcos gon Zach vaida so he had a lot of
the top players there that he was
training with throughout the preseason
and I think that's given you know that
gives players confidence just doing
that it's massive in our sport isn't it
if you can practice with guys that are
better than you and especially of that
ilk we know what a year Fritz had in
2024 it's massive
bonus 15 and I think part of the problem
is with so many different cies that they
have these days
that's talent pool for me getss diluted
too much I think that was one of the
great things about the bot ter Academy
in the early days it was the only one
everybody went everybody practiced and
greatness I think makes people even
better he got him while he was
vulnerable he was on his back was quite
Humane though wasn't it yeah it's well
cushioned there within the
tle so next I think getting all the guys
together at Carson one you know maybe
two practice venues Carson in Orlando
brilliant right yeah absolutely and you
know going back to Eric Diaz I mean Eric
Dias has done a lot of work with Alex
melson and learner Tian both so learner
TN I think is getting Confidence from
the you know I think learner's getting
Confidence from the amount of matches
that Alex melson is winning as well
right so seeing your good buddy who
you're used to training with day in and
day out and you start to feel like hey
man I can do this as well
yeah we call this indirect wins well I
beat you in practice and you beat Fitzy
so therefore I can really beat
Fitzy well he didn't need an indirect
win to work that out I
did good Stu
offense I I did play Fitzy once I must
tell you Nick fin on a quales at wiland
and Fitzy was already in he was top seed
and they were lucky losers and
irrespective of whether he won or loss
to me he was going to be in and I
thought he was going to throw me a bone
but you know how these tough old aies
are
right yeah I mean f he's a champion
right Champs don't want to just give
things away I mean come on Robbie he's
not going to just throw you a bone like
that I mean that was my chance to get
into the main draw
throw a bone that's that's a great old
saying is that is that a South African
one or is that an Australian I think
it's Universal from Texas baby throw a
bone
M I haven't watched a lot of learner
play in the last two years 18 months I
watched him in the finals of the Juniors
at the US Open him and
vona and he was definitely a lot more
underpowered I'm liking what I'm seeing
already Fitzy he lost to vona in that US
Open junior boys
final but his legs have got
stronger he doesn't look rushed at all
here he looks quite uh relaxed and
playing within himself
well that's a good sign for
me play at one pace and then accelerate
out of
nowhere hey guys and it's pretty cool
down here you know we looked at the
temperature about 64° F and it's praying
pretty slow and I think that's why
learner Tenn just seems like he's well
within his realm right now and he's
staying on that Baseline he doesn't look
rushed at all
[Applause]
out
it's born in Irving California an area
you know well to Vietnamese parents was
learner just a couple of miles away from
where my beautiful wife Jenny and I used
to live where was that Newport Beach
California he's going to be tough to
beat isn't
he if not tonight in the near future I
would think he's he's he doesn't miss
much good timing you can see the ball
coming off the middle of the Racket and
he plays with
ease very clean technique understands
his leftin so well
he's K with nothing else
meddev great anticipation there but it
was a mistake from The Young American
here should he have let that one bounce
perhaps I mean's guessed twice well he
needed peripheral vision there Rob he
didn't need to hit before he hit that
volley meddev was already two or three
steps on his way
away he needed to be able to change
mid-stroke oh that is so clever stepped
wider to hit the serve and I thought for
sure he was going to go with the curve
ball out wide did the exact
opposite some nice Pace on it too 186
case
and
[Applause]
is what a competitor though medev is you
know it seems like learner is making
most of the plays here medv hasn't been
noticed much and yet
he's at break
point okay
at game points that Med gu twice on
could prove crucial he's off to a flyer
2-1 first set
[Music]
[Music]
yeah we
what an entertaining
start already had a couple of lengthy
exchanges
both players moving the ball around the
court magnificently
Safar
and the front there of course J
Simon who is now co- coaching with
saara I think was pretty sure was this
caught where J Simon
out play an epic match against Novak I
remember commentating on jovic beat him
in five
sets but on the way to the victory Novak
made 104
steerers Simo could do that to you drive
you delirious
[Applause]
out that's Eric Hernandez front right
strength and conditioning coach of
Daniel team is
it's been pretty much unchanged
until Jil Simon came on
board
15 takes that backand
early very simple with the way he hits
the ball seems like his margin for error
is great great because he of his
technical
Simplicity
thir knows where his racket face is
doesn't he learner
two Med de is a wonderful player I mean
I thought Le town there deserved almost
to win that point after accelerating on
the back hand here he changed the pace
of the ball and medv with such control
just keeps it in on the line
basically enjoyed that one
oh that's a good sign right there Ed
finishing at the net with considerable
appla and J simore actually started what
we thought was officially in year ago
about 2024 February time but we did find
out Midway through the season that he
had actually started in the December
before ah sneaky
yes practicing behind closed doors were
they they were and of course he enjoyed
good run to the to the finals here last
year did
Med I think that's a great thing you
know I'm sure they weren't practicing
behind Clos do I was just kidding but do
all the training when no one's watching
I love
that I reckon that's what Nick Monroe
would have
done yeah you know what i' like see him
15 Danny medev like what we just saw for
him to close out that that last service
game was coming to the net you know in
his previous match he was 15 of 30 net
points one so only 50% but coming in 30
times that's a lot for Danny Mev and so
that's what I think he's been wanting to
improve with Jill Simone and Jill
savara thirst
l
one thing that really like from Lear ta
so far in this match is just really
holding his ground staying on that
Baseline medev tried to change up a
little height with the forehand but
didn't affect learner so we'll see if he
stays on that Baseline and keeps trying
to attack but we still like to see him
come forward to the net just a little
bit
more what happened there Nick did you
catch the end of the conversation with
John yeah Danny wanted to see a replay
he want to see a replay of that last
shot to see if it caught the
line he knows the technology would would
give him the
[Applause]
answer was hugely frust frustrated in
his his Opening
match against the Tha wild
cord K Sam who took him to five
sixs just couldn't get his game going
and eventually when he did he was able
to run away with it but he took the
scenic route five set it was
teen winning his first match at a major
in the main draw of
course against Ugo
Carabelli of
Argentina that was a lot longer 64 in
the fifth
yeah we're talking about learner TN
going five sets like that and again he
did his offseason at Carson with Rodney
Marshall one of the strength and
conditioning coaches for Alex melson and
Rodney was working with pretty much all
the guys
there mikkelson tenen SPID so he looks
fit right now learner
T once again he's just looking at the
line
there that shot this one here looking
awfully close using the full length of
the
[Music]
Court oh cat Mouse
medev is at the top of the
tree in that
respect pretended he was going to hit a
normal backand and chops underneath it
took a risk though because that was a
pretty good approach shot there but the
deaf little touch of crosscourt
sneaky so we like it oh yeah
f
[Applause]
[Music]
oh it's not easy to outmaneuver
medb sending him from east to
west with the very best that he's got to
offer
do you think the nature of the way Dan
plays hurts him at the back end of these
Mages I mean he he plays a lot of long
rallies a lot of long points and matches
I mean just that stat alone the last
four matches he's played at Melbourne
Park he's played five
sets uses a lot of
energy they both used a lot of energy in
the opening five games but danil has the
break 3-2
oh no
another player from
California between California and
Florida so many great players have been
produced um in those two stat
and given uh all the tragedy that's been
going on in California over the last
couple of days we we send our best
wishes to all those that are
struggling and the entire tennis
community is thinking of
you and uh we're keeping you in our
thoughts and prayers
so many of our good friends live out
that
way 15
[Applause]
15
look how well he measures this
shot I has to be that good anything
shorter than that may would have been
all over it
such a clean
hit 15 yeah learner TI is just not
giving up any ground behind this
Baseline even if he's having to take one
or two steps back he's looking to move
back forward into the next shot and
Danny madev has been on the run here
certainly one of those players isn't
here and a young player at that to
understand what risk and
reward he he he doesn't overly risk when
he's rallying so that keeps his mistakes
to a minimum and then when he sees an
opportunity to go harder at a ball he
does it's it's a good sign of an
intellectual young
Player 13 14
some players never understand what risk
and reward is and it holds them back yep
yeah
it's awesome shot
making three games on almost immune to
the pressure of the break
[Applause]
point Ian look at the
spread video of
covering full width of the
Court easy power
[Applause]
I think he deliberately took the speed
off both of those backhands there maybe
maybe because he didn't want to take too
much risk and hit the ball with more
speed which would lower his percentage
but I like the fact he he snuck in
quietly there but medev cagely made him
play tough ball for
yeah guys even though lost those last
couple points as you said 50 he's
changing the speed little bit of slice
the backand he's hitting one flatter
then one a little bit slower so trying
to throw Danny medev off but medev is
just his ball tolerance is just so high
so we'll see if going to try to get in a
little bit more I mean they've already
played 16 rallies over nine
[Music]
shots I tell you one thing he's in
advanced 19yearold
[Applause]
that age group
19 No No
19 yeah like Bad to the Bone you know
like these kids are these kids are good
and there's a handful of them now the
new generation the Next
Generation he's Beyond his years this
young man
Fu I'm impressed and uh even even if he
can't maintain this level for a long
period of time he's showing his signs
here that he is a player of the
future has his own
style his own strengths and weaknesses
obviously but there's going to be a lot
of strengths here
Nick I just wonder if the the pace of
medvedev's ball suits lar T though down
to the ground yeah it sure does I mean
look meddev hasn't been able to get it
out of the strike zone of lar T and it's
because he's been so close to that
Baseline he's almost daring meddev to go
for a little bit more and that's why
he's taking it early moving medev
further behind the court as you can see
there he's pushing medev around
oh heck of a smash seriously good smash
that was not easy got some great skills
this
guy and he leads 4 three in the first h
[Applause]
wow I mean what a great all round
game just give us a good idea of the
patterns of play and the guys are using
how much risk they are wanting to
assume nice injection of pace there 140
and that is more
spin fourway forward is a good one
he's not scared to go after the smash
and as soon as he gets a for he knows
it's going to be effective so he's
looking to come in and already the net
points
one is five of
eight and he hasn't been deterred when
he's lost one or two time
there no question that ver has been well
coached and was important to recognize
those who perhaps came a little early on
in his career I know my good friend
Christian Gro who is based in San
Diego said done a lot of work with him
as well in the earlier
days they still stay in touch a lot
Chris of course a wealth of knowledge he
helped develop so many players Brandon
nashima was with him for a long time as
was Taylor
Fritz Marcus gon often tapped his uh
tennis
intelligence of course CH Tommy horse
for so many years did Chris so he knows
what the Pinnacle of the sport looks
like he understands the work that's
required the German of course so he can
imagine the discipline every time you
take to the court with
him he's tough I like it
on a laundry
[Applause]
line 13
[Applause]
15 can get to some pretty awesome
serving
grooves that guys just amazing Lear hits
a great shot and he almost wants to kind
of celebrate a little bit but then this
guy's up to serve so quickly and he just
gets right back on top of you
4 1
[Applause]
F I'm sure learner 10 has his attention
here this is perilously close
he going down in the in the first set
he's he's got some work to do
here I think what learner probably
doesn't have at this St so is the
ability to accumulate some free points
at Big times with this first serve it's
like gold for medev
[Music]
je uses the lines well that's a sign of
a a player who's got great control over
his racket face isn't it I mean he can
just redirect down both lines backhand
and
forehand good control isn't it Nick yeah
amazing control and again just the body
weight the body weight's always moving
forward into the shot he's staying low
throughout all the B balls when he's
that close to the Baseline so impressive
out of this
world
32 mesmerizing
shots advantage
well he just anticipated there he was I
thought he was gone because the drop
shot wasn't really good enough and medev
made a mistake as happened to him or as
he caused a few games ago when he
anticipated an approach shot
so a difficult moment
out it's keeping him in it right now the
first surve and I remember that served
so well during the 2023 season Fitzy
when he was just sweeping all before
him
thanks Danny Med has been having to work
so hard out here there's a little bit of
sweat on the Melbourne sign just wanting
the ball boy to wipe it
off that sweat wasn't from a bird was it
Nick haven't seen that many above
us you might need a hat down there m on
the side of the
court that is beyond
special he's playing Beyond his years
isn't he maybe not maybe he's just
playing normal he's he's this
good when you don't win three Futures in
a row two challenges after that make a
semi-final in the third one unless
you're a proper player
it's
Relentless intelligent
tennis and I'm talking about Teen not
netive well there's a couple things I'm
wondering about one is whether Dan is a
little little bit sluggish here I I I I
don't know whether he is he's a bit
confused right now I know
that and also whether he would prefer to
play someone who hits the ball heavier
and harder so he can use the speed more
there's not a lot of speed coming at him
I don't think and uh look it's harder to
tell from up here Nick but uh I've
beening your thoughts maybe after this
point as to with it
as to whether the speed of thing is
actually not giving medev the chance
to
rebound yeah I mean look as we said
before when the match started about 64
Dees F so the ball's moving pretty slow
through the court right it's a bit
slower learner TN just able to redirect
and M can't find any
winners but he's he's having to generate
a bit more Heist it seems yes yes you're
correct he has having to generate a bit
of his own pace and that's what lar is
making him do right he's using some
backhand slice he's changing up the flat
backand as well just not putting Pace on
it making medb try to hit a few more big
shots and learner T just so quick around
the court right now
[Applause]
[Music]
I'm going tell you one thing right now
this is just not affecting learner T I
mean he absolutely does not mind this at
all you feel like he could go four or
five hours if he needs
to he hasn't had much experience with
that link has he we certainly find out
if Med KN was down in early in the
second set he's got three set
points
please that's was a decorative set of
tenis take three a master Closs in all
Court
maneuvering
631 posting
some pretty impressive numbers perhaps
the most impressive he's winning 80% of
the points behind his second serve he's
been more effective behind his second
then he has his
first you don't see that too often and
in St contrast Med struggling to win any
points
behind his second
serve wow it's incredible just double
checking the raw numbers there Med was
only one of 11 behind his second
delivery
plenty of Baseline Ries plenty of long
Baseline
rallies we've already had 24 that have
gone n nine plus
shots it's t that's dominating those
longer Ries
yeah you know learner TN we talked about
wise beond his years you know in the US
we have the 18 under Nationals and he
won that that tournament when he was 16
then he won it again when he was
17
F so that at and under Nationals it's at
Kazo Michigan and it gives you a wild
card in the US Open so he won it two
years in a row at 16year old 17y old and
then the third year he didn't even play
cuz he didn't need to he had already won
enough points in the challengers to get
a wild card in the US Open so it's not
easy to win two of those national
championships in the states
that's
beautiful carve dead volley
up 13 15
[Applause]
14
[Applause]
[Music]
first game
[Music]
[Applause]
second so straight back at
it consultation with his Camp towards
the end of the opening set right after
he got broken there wasn't a lot of info
forthcoming I think both Jill Simon and
Jil Savar perhaps a little surprised at
how well larner was
playing i w dor still has Med as the
favorite to
win well I think he has to be favorite
to win from here I think I mean that's
my opinion I
mean the wind predictor I sometimes have
some confusion with
but if mvdv wins this set I wonder what
it would go to because it it would swing
even more heavily I think in his favor
he he
doesn't look like he's uh well he looks
like a guy that's got off the plane to
me sometimes here and no disrespect to
learner at the moment but Danel
is he's not at the peak of his powers
right now
but FY I'm going to argue that I don't
think he's allowed to to have been at
the peak of his P because that's how
good TI has been himself no I don't
disagree with that he's been awfully
good but I just feel like the movement
of Dan is not quite right I that's how I
see it
mhm but but heck of a shot there but not
for one second would I want to take away
any of credit for what's happened in
this first set it's been very very
impressive yeah I think the movement
from learner ten has just really
affected Danny meev and and what he
wants to do on the court right normally
he's able to kind of out rally you his
shot tolerance is just more than you but
so far learning TN just been faster
around the court made more balls used
some short slice he's really confusing
medev
out 1
it's pretty clear what a great tennis IQ
that this guy's got we
know that in that department Med is one
of the best but this guy's matching him
and then some
I don't know about you f but old which
some of these young players
play
and you just watch and for me it's about
the level I look at the game and I try
not look too much at the stats and I
think what am I seeing what level is
that and when you've watched as many
matches as we we do you get a very good
idea of where that game is going to fit
in
and certainly what I've seen in the
opening hour here very impressed with
with
larner there a reason
why his rise has been so quick to the
cusp of the top 100
out I think if he starts to compete at
to a
level a little bit more he's going to
get so much more experience it's going
to test his game it's going to make him
grow as a
player just get better
and I would say even though it's a bit
unusual prop this thought process
but he's playing a guy rank five in the
world a guy that's been in this final
this tournament's final three times what
a player medev is but strangely enough
it seems like medvedev's game suits him
yeah the matchup the matchup it does it
doesn't hit him off the Court gives him
time to use use his you know clever play
and to redirect the ball
that's a bit different that's a heck of
a
shot but medv hasn't hurt him has he
you're
right I want to say it's teen who's got
more winners than media he's just
musling him in that department not by
much but still is
keep in mind I or I need to keep in mind
we're only 58 minutes into this yeah if
we if we reassess in an hour and 58
we'll have a lot better
idea because if he because if this young
lad can maintain this level for another
full
hour then you start thinking he he can
win
this he played 3 hours in 56 minutes in
the previous round to
10 but he wasn't playing down on medip
was he no
[Music]
consecutive erors there hurts him
doesn't it out of nowhere really I just
noticed that the back hands that he does
Miss tend to be in the net to take the
net out of play cuz he does hit that
shot pretty flat
yeah Danny medev just had the ball girl
grab two of his rackets from from the
sideline and give it to Jill sabar to
get it rung so I think he's going to
seems like he probably wants to get a
little bit looser you know again it's
cool down here the ball's not moving
very fast so I think he wants to get a
little bit more pop on it
long
he's done that a couple of times and
he's he's not
realizing how quickly I think Tan's
taking off for that open court and he's
there easily there's probably not enough
on that backend volley either is their
neck I mean he he he's got the ability
to hit that harder I think too
second
out yeah you're right fzy I mean how
often do we talk about it when you know
player is so fast like a learner TN
sometimes you need to go behind that
player right I mean they're going to
take off on the run as soon as they see
the open court and it's got to be
absolutely perfect for Tien not to get
that and if you are going to go open
court maybe a drop volley to make him
come forward but mayad might need to go
behind Tien a little bit more in those
situations
out 15 14
[Applause]
let
it's just mesmerizing and
magnificent 32 shots again and the long
R goes the way of the young American
this is good stuff 21
[Applause]
[Music]
great length from
both everything well over halfway
especially for teen look at that a back
third of the Court he just pummeling
now that one was a little short and come
the change UPS nice depth of the
slice uses the backand slice so int
diligently just when he's got him in
trouble patient
pounding well we
witnessed some clean ball striking top
tier stuff
and he was down a break in the opening
set 3-1 was 10 didn't bet an isid not
one complaint to his coaching corner
just got on with the job at
hand made one or two mistakes and then
just corrected
it made one or two mistakes in his last
service game especially for the backhand
side so let's keep an eye on
that certainly was fine when he was
returning missed a couple of back hands
in the net let's see how this service
game unfolds
guys from watching down to here just the
change of pace that Lear tian's putting
on the ball has been really good but
Danny meddev he's got to be careful when
he got broken there he hit a ball in the
backdrop about as hard as he could about
10 ft from the ball girl that's the
second time he's done that and I'm
surprised he hasn't gotten a warning yet
but he's got to be careful
f
f l
[Applause]
out 15
[Applause]
1 15
[Applause]
f
little
careless the junk
ball it's CA teen problem
there and again you wouldn't really know
if he's won or lost that previous this
point okay only way I can affect the
outcome of the match is to do my best on
the next
one
F
15 let
let's go let's go let's go
[Applause]
I think an indication
ofby learner 10 is that he is so
balanced he's got a very quick First
Step he's a quick athlete but yeah he's
so balanced when he gets to the ball he
never he doesn't well never he he he
doesn't look rushed too often especially
as a young player he's in position well
isn't he so he's got plenty of time to
use his hands and direct the ball where
he wants to so light on his
feet and good speed there too when he
had to he lengthened The Stride didn't
he
F oh he got it easily
15
14 Daniel has done
well just to keep this rally
alive extending himself to his absolute
limits with every fiber of his
being out okay
couple of breaks in a row we back on
serve they lead 32 second set first set
to 10

for entertaining tennis
out now 7 half th000 when we're 15
packed to the rafters here on the
Margaret Court
Arena saw Pat rafter
today he's in fine form fine
fettle I would say the great man
isn't it strange in this sport of ours
how sometimes it's super difficult to
break serve and and then all of a sudden
there'll be four lost in a
row which may well happen here mhm
ah
oh 15 actually five in a row if we had a
break here
Nick you missed a similar Inside Out
forehand earlier on in the game by a
millimeter or two I just love the fact
that it doesn't bother him it's almost
like he knows he's hit that shot as well
as he possibly can and it doesn't affect
him because he knows the next time it's
going to be better
yeah he just looks so calm at all times
right you never see him really get
negative on himself if he misses a shot
he said you know what I'm going to bring
in my target I learn my lesson and I'll
be right back to in a positive form his
reset is so good
Med is starting to get very ansy on the
other
end oh you know we talk about how he
just again misses a shot gets right back
to reset you know his name is learner
and it's an interesting name and he got
it from his mother's profession she was
a math teacher and he also has a sister
and her name is Justice got her from her
father's profession as an attorney but
learner learns his lessons and moves
on cunning and
calculated the lawyer and the
mathematician
[Applause]
when are you going to put that hard
covered book
out I want him to do it Nick I want him
I'm going to buy it yeah you got to let
us know I'm going to buy it y sell it in
the state sell it everywhere you've got
your first two customers right
here 13 15
F I'm a little concerned if he loses
this serve what might happen
[Music]
in
a I guess we don't need to say anything
and I've just broken the silence but
what a beautiful point that
was had everything oh this kid's Got
Game he's got
reflexes he's got tennis intelligence
yeah anticipation too Robbie look
world
class what a point to bring up another
break
point scandalous
T
TI is red lining at the moment he's up
to s in the
break t leads full games to
three pration and spct warning Mr
M but he's got all the Angles and
answers at the
moment Med's given it the full Boomerang
well the definition of that is that it
might come back and I guess at the end
it did but only via a ball girl a ball
boy that anger was pent up we could feel
it coming could you called it Fitzy you
called
it yeah guys and actually he actually
hit hit the camera at the back of the
Baseline on the single sideline when he
the point before so actually two points
in a row he had a little frustration
Nick there's a lady sitting not far away
from where that racket went over the
side time the side boundary there the
side border and it it it clicked up and
went over the side it could have easily
hit her that's that's instant default
that could have ended in disaster that
ret throw
because that only has to touch an
official and he he wasn't too Pleasant
to a few of people in the stands either
by the way but
uh he's got some pined up anger
Dan and finds himself down a setting a
break yeah if you're l t you just got to
keep playing solid tennis and that's why
I mentioned it before when Danny Med
medev got broken he had hit a ball in
the backdrop and just that pin up energy
and negative energy was creeping into
his game
out very loose points that he's played
double f in it Miss back
[Applause]
in certainly midf if will will calm down
a lot quicker after two points like that
play can win a point behind their second
Ser it's
[Applause]
unbelievable TI is oh from 10 now and
second serves in the set
stay away from the seconds just hit
first hit them hard and
[Applause]
accurately if is not a whole lot
better he's also Zero from 10 cuz the
three points
1 14
[Applause]
[Applause]
the first three points there he just
lost his concentration didn't
he he's handed that back to
meddev yeah it really looked like
learner tenen just kind of lost his
footwork he stopped moving you know
we've seen how fast he's been around the
Baseline throughout the course of this
match but it was almost like he was kind
of just hoping medad would kind of miss
some shots and stop moving his feet
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
30 love
[Applause]
13 15
[Applause]
well this is turned
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
quickly a huge difference from when
Danielle makes the first serve versus
the second
out that was a med bit of special right
there back to his very
best working the full dimensions of the
court to take a 54 lead in the
second well why we take a quick look at
danil medb frustration
package he's looking a bit more settled
now but he's been given the run around
boom it like
that shouldn't be getting jerked around
like I am
[Applause]
got the full
[Applause]
treatment he
is patience has been tested yeah and
that's not the first camera he's had a
crack out is it over the last couple of
days he wasn't too happy with the the
center strap camera
he's navigated a frustrating period only
just as danil
medb was up a break 4-3 in the second
set
play two poor
points to try and extend his
lead he's down l30 in no time hasn't got
as much rle room now at 45
let out 15
[Applause]
out got to be careful here the youngster
doesn't he just going a little bit of
Ry the last three games needs to be
tight here no errors
out 13
15 it's well managed on his back hand
side around then he'll
leak couple of four stas off that
backand Wing actually in
total it's the backand that's offered up
more than four stas for for learner than
the
[Applause]
forehand 15 for him
[Music]
[Music]
he's a skill Merchant this kid yeah that
fabulous comeback there in that point 14
[Music]
15 he can take it any direction can he
loves the
line and sees an opening
too I mean it's it's incredible to think
that in the long rallies he has
dominated made V 26-4
F that's nine plus
shots I mean that is what is normally
mid's
strength
14 perhaps that the effect of the
previous Point
go yeah a little bit of the previous
point but also with learner Tan's serve
he typically slices his serve he doesn't
have a lot of kick on it not a lot of
roll so if he's not feeling his serve
that's when he hits some double faults
cuz there's not a lot of margin for
airor
out
game five games
over this has been a good cont contest
I've enjoyed
it for 90 minutes now he's been going
toet to Toe with denil midb if why are
you looking over your shoulder at
me what I I thought he dropped off the
pace there for a
second
but but no this is impressive for a
19yearold to maintain this
L you never know he might just snatch
the second
[Applause]
set medv look at that that means he's
losing a lot of points from the back of
the Court four from 26 when he hits the
second Serv
in that's an indication the backourt
play of larner 10 has the better of him
at the moment
here's another one
[Applause]
he has embroided this match with his
class and his variety look at the shape
of that
shot cool as you like he's got
presentence he's
clear thinker
huh
out guys you talk about the variety
learner t on that second serve he was
almost standing in the middle of the
Court just almost wanting to bait medev
to go out wide with the second so he's
getting in the head of
[Applause]
medev let
[Applause]
134 ladies and Gentlemen please let's
not start calling out during the point
thank
[Applause]
you f
it's the chuggernaut that is learn
ten that just keeps pluging
away and he is breaking down midb store
[Music]
right e
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
time oh when it comes to tennis
intelligence
medev is has been one of the very best
over the last couple of years last year
was a bit of a struggle for him no doubt
about that didn't WN a
title but so far this evening he has
been
outsmarted he hasn't played
poorly Lara 10 has just been that good
he's got a chance to serve for two sets
to love lead
L 15 about you Nick but I like that play
and fortunately Danielle doesn't like to
come in too much but with that flat
strike
teens's margin for error is quite low on
the backhand passing shot
yeah Robie you're right I mean if he can
come in to learner tm's backhand again
if somebody has a flat backand on the
pass it's easier to volley right because
it's not going to dip at your feet it's
not going to have any shape to it but
lear's got to be careful here this is
where he got in trouble when he was up a
break a couple games ago just got to
keep his feet moving keep the
intensity just just doesn't get three
points in the first serve you know at
least he played two better points to
open up his service game Med have just
played better than him he didn't donate
them that's another good return yeah I
was watching Jacob Inc last night just
serve out a a set and then a match and
he just hit bombs y
that is such a luxury to have well it is
and it makes it more complicated doesn't
it when you're not as tall you can't
bomb that serve as much and you've got
to fight for every Point as clever as he
is
game
M six game go tie
bre wow
that was the eighth break of serve that
we've had in this set eighth yeah you
heard
correctly we had three in the opening
stanza you got to remember both these
guys played five set as in the previous
round teen was out there for almost 4
hours out 1
Z yeah we're seeing so many returns be
put back in play again because of how
cool it is out here again 64° fah the
balls are pretty big right now that's
why we're seeing so many returns being
back in play
f
right
was that a tap out there for
Mid he's he's not wrestling Rob guys I
was watching learnard C it barely looked
like he was even breathing he was just
enjoying that entire point I mean Medved
was working so hard to try to keep
learner Tien on a string and he was so
calm was Tien throughout that point
impressive from the 19-year-old mhm
he certainly looks like he's working
harder doesn't
he yeah medev is you know when I'm
watching both of these guys up close
neev is breathing harder he's grunting
louder Lear tian's barely grunting at
all and just kind of he's like hey I can
hang in these rallies over 40 shots if I
need to so medv is going to have to try
to get in because learner tn's
armor is available
w
I mean he cannot hit it any
deeper I me this is what you hope for
both players playing well at the same
time using their full skill set
no
way I'll explain how that gets called
now if you're wondering about the
electronic line
calling oh my
goodness I wonder if we've got a camera
on that maybe not or we do 3
2 so that's an electronic call no it's
not sorry it's not no somebody is
watching in a one of the officials is
watching in a booth they're watching
that camera fit and as soon as the
football takes place the football they
press the button
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
yes thank you ladies and Gentlemen
please thank you ready for play thank
you you can't challenge a foot fault
call either
[Music]
[Applause]
guys well the players have the ability
to challenge the the calls when they're
being made why you know why on the video
board can't we see that footfall like we
saw on the screen here you know for medv
I think it would give him a piece of
mind if he could see it on the big
screen out
here I'm a bit lost with the
conversation but I mean I understand
you're
[Applause]
frustrated he looks like a volcano
doesn't he about to explode
Med I mean it would be so unfortunate if
that is what decides the outcome of the
second set tie break given how good the
quality of the tennis has been
hey 4 three
[Applause]
10 a brutal gladiatorial
combat disguised as a tennis match right
now
[Music]
please respect both players you can
support who you like but please respect
both
players yeah well said John taking
control of the situation immediately
good
officiating f
[Applause]
f
out
[Music]
five well it was risky changing that
direction that was a fine line there and
he he rolled the dice
he
[Applause]
64 great tactical
Acumen he's identified the forehand of
medf and he gave him plenty to think
about in that
rally two set points
it doesn't get better than that
second Lona 10 takes two sets to love
lead against Daniel medv what a breaker
Le by two
well it's an hour and 52
Robbie almost exactly an hour ago you
said let's see where we are I mean
couldn't have played out any better
gee he was clutch wasn't he the
youngster this is really a mature
performance couldn't win uh didn't have
I felt like saying at 54 time for a big
serve y but he it's not really there and
he he has to battle from the back of the
court but how steady was
he such good decision making that's
what's impressed me so much Fitzy
dep on the ground strokes wonderful
[Applause]
guys I was interested to see what n Dev
was going to try to change Maybe in that
first point and see if that's going to
be an indication for the rest of the
match but the drop shot is something
that's interesting right because learner
so close to the Baseline so it's not
really going to affect him because he's
going to get up to it
[Applause]
quickly and Robie you mentioned you know
speaking with your coaches metev has
been yelling at Jill Simone and Jill
Simone has just been saying le la hasn't
really given him much input so
far
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
out yeah the tennis intelligence will be
tested
[Music]
pretty big game isn't it the the first
one after a long break like that just to
reestablish your momentum
[Applause]
guys and just one more thing I think
something that's been helping out Lear
Tien is his surf you know he only has
three double faults in his last round he
had 16 double faults in that match when
he went five sets so I think that helps
him feel better about himself when he's
serving better and not having that
double faults and so he's getting a
better Rhythm throughout his
game p you were asking this question a
little earlier there's your answer that
is a mighty big swing because after the
first set medv was still a solid
favorite
[Applause]
fol
[Applause]
I think the positive learner TM can take
from these Drop shots from edev is is
that he can realize that meev thinks
he's got to do something different to
beat to beat
him lost a bit of confidence to play him
in with his normal game from the back of
the
Court changing his game because he needs
to that's
a bit of a bolt of confidence I would
have thought for the younger player
[Applause]
out but I guess he's challenge now is
he's maintain the two hours
Robbie has to keep it going there to win
this if he drops off 5% it can turn very
quickly to clever play
did two things in a row that you we
didn't expect I certainly didn't he he
snuck in here hadn't done this all match
really and then you think he's going to
drill a volley
deep drops it short
see
out 1
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
F go
oh wow well we're seeing a different
style of play now Nick anyway though
he's trying to
change change up the the
uh the attack isn't he coming in a lot
more H and drop volle yeah you got to
change the Rhythm right you know learner
tn's been on the Baseline dictating so
you know met videv saying okay I'm going
to do something as a bit out of my
character and see if that's going to
affect
[Applause]
you you know even if it doesn't work out
say some of the Drop shots you know that
learner Tenn is getting up for maybe
that'll you know take the legs out of
learner Tian a little bit you know have
him come up and back as opposed to side
to side so you got to try something
different and and see what'll
happen catches the outside edge
[Applause]
this one just licks the
line it's just been Rel
Relentless
Relentless he's up 21 in the
third well I've been so impressed from
the ground stroking of larner 10 and
he's coming here with a definitive plan
and he has
given medev a steady D to four ands
hasn't he it's really plugged away at
that corner
it's the slightly weaker wing of M ever
and especially towards the T end of that
TI break we saw that accentuated even
further that's where he's been getting
most of his Joy he's happy to Rally
Cross Court with the back
hand he's been taking a lot of fors down
the line as well but he keeps him just
enough honest doesn't he with the 34%
going
down to the back end wing
it's a perfect
spread
[Applause]
time well certainly no harm done so far
for the youngster in this set he's he's
still got his nose in
front not a lot of wiggle room now for
meddev
even though he has a mountain of
experience guys again you know what's so
impressive for me with learner Tenn is
just every single ball has a purpose
right and as a coach when you're
teaching players no matter what level
you tell them hey if you're going to hit
it high and heavy have a purpose with it
if you're going to use a slice look for
the purpose with that shot and for
learner tenen it's just it's just so
amazing to see at 19 years old how cool
calm and collected he is and with
purpose
yeah that's a great description
Nick purpose every ball that gets
struck and I think that's what I was
alluding to is that
because every shot has purpose he can
walk away from the previous point so
easily cuz he's know he knows he's done
everything he possibly
can thank
[Music]
like guys for instance on that shot
right there you know on the second serve
he went further back so that he could
hit the ball deep and he moved up in the
court on the SEC the second ball to hit
it flatter to then get the short ball
and use a drop shot so every ball he
moved up in the court on those three
balls out
[Applause]
I think the tactic as
well taking away the wide second serve
for Med has been just bang on
tactically points have all of a sudden
become much shorter
no long no longer the extended rallies
here it's a lot to do with Med Med's
tactics I
think oh good change
[Applause]
[Music]
up I tell you what he he's been more
like denil mackenro in the last couple
of games
it's coming in a lot
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
I think we talk about where players get
Confidence from and we were discussing
earlier how learner tenen over the
offseason was trained with the
California boys Taylor Fritz melson
Marcos gon they all three won today and
I think that's given him some confidence
here too
F
Well Nick I'm not blaming you but was
that a little bit of a commentator's
curse we'll see what happens here so
long ways to go yeah never a good time
is there for that
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
1
[Applause]
a plenty of breaks of serve that have
occurred
yeah there's the target again he's hit
that shot so well to Mid
forehand spin control is
perfect quarter is much shorter because
you're so far up
it out
I just get the feeling medev is getting
a little more erratic with his ground
strikes he's starting to miss earlier in
the rally but in fact they both have to
be fair but certainly the points are
shorter how telling will this game be
tell you what that four 's got some
horsepower another meaty
blow 323
[Music]
[Music]
sheer
frustration CU this guy has just had
said all the answers
[Music]
[Music]
oh DJ's bringing
out some uh vintage Aussie Tunes
off to the Midnight
[Applause]
Hour beats a little bit of John
[Applause]
far just to accentuate how well Le has
played in the opening two
sets I have I have never seen
meddev change his game so dramatically
like I have in the first five games of
this set
so do you think that
is because he wants to change his game
because he thinks he can't win the other
way or do you think it's got something
to do with the fact that he's just run
out of a little bit of gas the late
flight to Australia M that the emotion
he's been through with his family with a
new young baby no you're what you're
right that that would have to be a
factor
out cuz I I know he quite often looks
like this on a tennis court but I just
can't help thinking
that there's got to be some tiess there
and this young man has worn him down for
nearly well 2 hours and 22
minutes so he either thinks he can't win
the way he normally plays or War he's a
bit jaded you would think
can you believe this kid's
19 that's Hogwart stuff right there
Wizardry from the
[Applause]
Lefty T tennis vacular we call that
[Music]
toying absolutely toyed with of
there there's another sign though Robbie
desperation thinking he can't win if he
plays
normal two first serves yeah takes a
risk
[Music]
very
good there tentacles of Med Bev coming
in very handy
[Applause]
[Applause]
m b of
covering almost
10% more than 10
can't tell you how good that
is the change of direction is is a very
difficult thing to
do with that accuracy within half a
meter of that
[Applause]
sideline this comes well across court
and he changes Direction and controls
it B
oh that's a bit of Spice from
Dan he's trying to keep the point
shorter surely
M
fans still Harbor Ambitions that he can
get out of this Jam that he's in he's
come back from two sets to two sets to
love down on four occasions and the last
two were were last year right
here f
against zv and Rus
vori come back from behind against very
was in the samis
[Music]
the other two were at
Wimbledon
and excuse me another one here yes of
course at the Australian Open in 2022
against Felix in the
quarters so it's been a a happy hunting
ground for him as far as coming from
behind is concerned
the nature of five sets and the and the
Peaks and valleys and The
Comebacks are because momentum changes
in five
sets and it can change
often but if you if you're down two sets
to love and you win one
set Bingo all of a sudden you can win a
second one very quickly it it changes
rapidly so he's not out of it you'd be a
brave man to suggest so
[Applause]
but he does look a tiny bit hagged here
I would think
and but he's a master coming
[Applause]
back so much shorter aren't they
than what we saw in the first two sets
[Applause]
FY
can you believe
it well I would have uh backed him there
n out of 10 times he was going to make
that that's an easy shot for him in the
end it was just that there was tension
and
he medv he had meddev on the wrong side
of the Court he would rarely miss out I
would
think that's the kind of point that
could affect a player psyche
out goodness mate massive turnaround in
a few points there yeah put a
asterisk alongside both of those midb
leads 43 with a break in the
[Music]
third oh we're just talking about the
variety that teen has this is just a
quick look at a second serve return hit
point you can see how early he takes it
on the DU side cutting off the angle
with his backand and that's what's been
targeted most of the time by med but on
the the left hand side of your screen
what he's doing is he's running around
that serve and actually a lot of those
contact points are for hands he's
employing a completely different tactic
from the outside he wants to get the
forehand on that turn and more often
than not he has got it hit the ball nice
and Deep and got himself back into play
but always giving Med a different
look variety is been a big part of his
game this evening
once
again still a crowds for day
five and we're not done
yet f
15
[Applause]
[Music]
59
just made some good volleys in the SI I
don't say though Robbie that one was off
the Thro he he got lucky on that one
yeah he's made some good volleys but
he's getting super close to the net on
pretty much every ball he'll make one
and then he'll just charge the net and
and hope it comes right to him and as
you said Fitzy that was right off the
throat
FY sound like this guy so when somebody
hits a PN even if it goes in the side
door you go ooh so lucky they will
always remind you that they're picking
it out of the hole Nick doesn't matter
how it gets there hey you know that's
what you tell people that's why you pay
for the whole racket these guys are
getting them for free but that's why you
pay for the whole thing
exactly what is my P away tend to stay
on the
rim
again if you weren't with us we had that
early stages
of the second set tie
break crucial
footfall what is that was the sixth
point where it happened
ended up being a Tipping Point in the
second set tie
break out
he just wants to destroy that b he wants
to hit it out the
[Applause]
[Music]
stadium that was directed
yeah we've got the ref one of the
supervisors sitting on the side there
and he's been he's been taunting him for
quite a while and I think John Blom got
the nod to give him a point
penalty that hurts him a bit 30 Love Now
is a quick Breakaway isn't it oh such a
bonus at four all to get the first point
on serve right he he was just pushing
and pushing and pushing to see how far
he could go and then just totally
accepted the the point penalty when it
happened
well what a quick turnaround this
is it could be the penultimate
game there's Jake
[Applause]
Conner he gave the fake hit the ball in
his Direction that's what cost
him you get another one here in a minute
if he's not careful tanel
this downan shots have been
superb and he's got Med on the ropes now
at 54 in the third
[Music]
we take a
break next
adventure London
Ed or
RIS or
duin and0 cities acoss Europe but
remember it's not just the destination
it's also how you get there
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
it's been a change of ends where Daniel
has just been staring into Oblivion so
much going on I guess
behind those
eyes trying to find
solutions to try and unpick the learner
TM
game so far those Solutions have been
very hard to come
by thank you ready for play please thank
you he's serving to stay in this contest
left
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
this is pretty impressive
feel plenty of P purchase on that
one nice little 60° wedge coming into
play
there
out 4
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
an authoritive hold
15
[Applause]
l b one here
everything's dden including his
vision
out yeah what I love seeing from learner
Tian is he's still just taking his 25
seconds in between points not rushing
obviously such a big moment right now
anyone could have a tendency to want to
try to get it done but he's taking his
time 4
and Rob mentioned how that might be a
good play coming into the back in of
learner TM because it's so flat but he
takes it so early and he can put a lot
of pace behind it as well that's what
makes it a good
pass just what the doctor
ordered learner the Speedy
hold 65 it is third set two sets to love
[Music]
all right it's time to put your hands
together and get ready to game set clap
let's
go oh this is too easy
F need energy in this for
[Applause]
Round of
[Music]
[Applause]
Applause time
[Applause]
of course this would be the biggest win
of learner TI's career sure to get the
better of
Daniel with big wins come of the big
Milestones he would break the top
100 on the live rankings if he were to
progress he' clock in at around Number
96
in the
world be through to the third round at a
major for the first time but still some
work to be done
[Music]
[Applause]
Robie an absolute laser down the line
and learner Tien throughout this match
he's been trying to get the crowd
engaged he's really embracing this
moment I think that's really relaxing
him as well he's been so accurate to
that quadrant of the Court
[Applause]
HED in on mv's forand so well so much so
that danil is trying to hit it back in
even from that forehand
Corner much preferred to hit it versus
the
forehand 14
Rob one thing I noticed is Danny meev
these last two service games has been
taking more time in between points
obviously knows how important these
moments are so he's taking his time a
few more deeper
breaths out yeah two impressive service
games when serving to stay in the match
I
remember three
or in that second set tiebreaker edv got
caught for a foot fault and that proved
The Tipping Point in the tie
break and it end up being backto back
serve so it was a double fault in
essence
1 you're always hoping that it's a
moment of magic rather than a moment of
Madness like that that determines the
outcome of such an
important piece of the match
[Applause]
F
out and I was thinking about it in the
second set TI break for me the the two
shots that are going to determine the
outcome of it or the backand of
tenen and the forand of midv how well do
they manage those two shots in this
moment
he's made
it yeah r t almost can't believe it
because he got up to that drop shot so
fast because again he's been up on that
Baseline he's he had plenty of options
and midev once again has just been
reading where he's going off of those
drop shot
approaches that's a huge gamble but it
paid
off
[Music]
out that Lefty serve of T is is almost
getting manino
esque it's got some serious slide on
it e
[Music]
show stopping from the
American Robie amazing watching TN just
move side to side for those shots there
was no tension in his face throughout
the course of every ball that he hit he
was so relaxed almost had a smile on his
face just enjoy in this moment and
moving and playing such a top
player incredibly impressive
[Applause]
[Music]
I don't know about unck but I always
used to find that three2 points in a tie
break
such a psychological one because in my
mind if if you won it and you were up 42
you had twice as many points as your
opponent versus changing ends at three
all when suddenly it's even yeah
absolutely Robbie and you know again
they now it's 24 and Med forgot where
the score was you know I think he's just
so out of out of rhythm medev that he
literally forgot that they needed to
change sides there but learnard t
is absolutely locked
[Applause]
in he has been so good in the big
moments you know Daniel is pretty good
Under Pressure
but in the points that determine the
outcome of games and
matches this guy has been way
ahead guess it's reflective in the score
line right
3 two
[Applause]
[Applause]
f
[Applause]
oh he almost got out of the jam
there I mean the Tentacles from medf Dev
unreal defense to keep that point alive
asking the question one more time to
learner
tenen and he got the
air out
[Applause]
four the for into that specific area of
the court it's been so
effective just let him down in backto
back points here in the tie break
not this
time not this
time
5 yeah there's the backend pass we were
talking about that it it might be flat
but it had so much Pace on it and he
knew meddev was going to be that close
to the net so that's why he ran forward
and was ready for the drop
volley 6 five
M was playing his best
tennis that serve was
devastating got him out of trouble so
often
and it's brought up a set point for
denil
athletic
autistic and
authorative
60 I mean the entire geometry of the
Court was used in this point short
slices deep approach shot I mean Danny
meev had a short slice in the court
where he was literally in the middle of
the court and backpedal back to the
Baseline I mean these two guys are
trying to take each other's legs from
each other but learner tenen is trying
to use this crowd right
now and he missed two by an inch maybe
even less just a couple of points to go
but just backs himself to make the
adjustments is no
fear absolute
[Applause]
trust thank you
[Applause]
7 6
[Music]
10 I can tell you that Danielle has
fought with every fiber of his
redoutable
being to stem the flow of youthful
aggression and Artistry from this guy
but it might not be enough match points
Tien s oh just like that it's snuffed
[Applause]
out lucky number 30
for M video of as far as aces are
concerned A7
[Applause]
[Music]
SI set
point you got to love
it pressure what pressure says learner
ten he's trying to say I'm the biggest
Warrior out here eight all in the
breaker Big Time
stuff how about
that a moment of magic perhaps for
[Applause]
Med it's just incredible isn't
it this is what you want to
see both guys playing well at the same
time plenty of drama so much on the line
set point number three
set medv medv digs deep
s and the battle
continues he wins the third in a tie
break and saves a match point along the
way
of tennis means we're into a full
[Applause]
set f
Robbie just one thing I think it was
it's actually a blessing in disguise for
Leonard tenen that he doesn't have to
serve first in this set after losing
such a tough tiebreak breaker in the
third just to kind of get his feet back
under him in a return game and if he
loses this that's okay and then he had
then he would serve the next game
[Applause]
[Music]
and just another thing worth noting with
medev he's just really been taking so
much more time in between serves now
over the last three service games that
he's had and that's led to more first
serves going in play
game
M
new first game for s
[Applause]
about brains trust in the mid
Camp so Ben Shelton F tiao went
down went down in five incidentally to
Fabian
Maran was Alex mikkelson somebody that
ear a 10 trains with quite a bit had a
straight sets win
out Marcus gon it's also part of that
training Squad in LA that Nick was
alluding to had a great win over Thomas
CH in five
oh yes please once again he has guess
[Applause]
correct so Robbie off just got back from
down on the court I was I was going to
do the interview I thought at match
point but it looked to me from down
there it's a different perspective and
and that's what Nick's got down there
but it it just seemed like medev
couldn't miss all of a
sudden I think you're right and you know
again when I was talking about his
service games how he was taking more
time in between points he was kind of
taking deeper breaths and I think that's
been helping the overall course of his
game just being able to make a few more
balls and more relaxed
out well he sort of reverted back didn't
he to his his normal way of playing Just
refusing to
miss instead of the shorter points that
we saw earlier in the
third and this is how a match can
swing there'll be a few negative
thoughts there in that young man's head
right now you would
think I mean you don't want to go Match
Point down but it might actually be a
blessing in disguise from Edward
ever I say that because we all know that
when you've had a match point and then
you haven't been able to convert you're
still playing it's very difficult to put
it out the back of your mind
mhm and there's repercussions isn't
there you're still thinking about it
early in the fourth set and quickly you
can be behind in that one
too then you might just drop off a
fraction it's uh it's a roller coaster
ride raise your B son 50 and for STS
[Applause]
[Music]
and I think you're learner tenm this is
where you got to think back to all the
preseason work that you did in LA with
those top guys with Fritz and Mickelson
and gon and all those hard yards you put
in and trying to make him pay off now
[Music]
oh
out that particular shot has just gone
off the boil yeah it's missing it a bit
[Applause]
as falling down the line for larner
[Applause]
out well suddenly te is hemorrhaging
unforced
and it's three level
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
already o hello
[Music]
almost must look like his touched the
court uh the net
there DJ's definitely been on top of his
game we've had had a bit of great local
artist these guys but might be
definitely top 10 in the rankings for me
do you know who this
is tell me what are we there's another
name for tennis
[Applause]
commentators sports commentators Talking
Heads well the other day you were
talking about Crowded House and Neil
Finn Talking
Heads come on tell me the lead
singer I think I'm right you're always
right Fitzy brother
off Tim Finn you're joking come
on look it up I might be wrong but I
don't think
so see that whole sort of atmosphere's
changed here hasn't
[Applause]
it doesn't see this one
coming 15 1
[Music]
[Applause]
it's as good as it
gets
134 no I'm wrong split ends I apologize
Tim fin I apologize it's late at
[Laughter]
night break points again
let the set is getting away from tenen
very
[Applause]
quickly f
out one of larner's greatest assets is
his shot
tolerance it's gone out the window in
this fourth set
is uncanny how often medb guesses the
right way when tian's got an easy
shot Advantage
CH out
reminding everybody that both of these
guys played five
Setters in their previous round medev
was on c for 3 hour 8
minutes was 3 56 minutes and his
standard has now dropped hasn't it he's
he's spraying more balls now the young
fell mhm
so he's lost his intensity I'm not sure
whether that's physical
or whether mentally he was down three
love I've got a feeling it might be a
little bit of
physicality perhaps needing a bit of
direction from coach Diaz
this set is certainly going to be quick
by the looks of
it 31
so he's not balanced now is
he he he not anything at the moment
for I think probably most of all he's
not interested what if he's thinking
about that match point he
had hi was serving
67 in that third set breaker
dropped the
hammer 14 15
[Applause]
okay
wow this has been Swift very quick F
[Applause]
[Music]
zip sometimes we just need to see the
possible
and not we thought
impossible to remind us to be
bold to climb
[Music]
higher your
next
here oh it's a different mood in the
camp now there's a couple of smiles
going around there
I reckon at least three out of four yeah
they were grimaces about half an hour
ago so they look like grim
reapers Nick do you have any feeling
about the physicality of lunner at the
moment yeah that's what I'm trying to
get a read on cuz it doesn't look like
he's cramping quite yet and you know he
was speaking with his coach Eric Diaz
and we're seeing just how fast these
points are going right and we know that
he normally uses his legs and can extend
points but I think he's just going to
try to get out of this game as fast as
he can and then let's see where he's at
from there
[Applause]
one thing's for sure on the Ser he's
definitely not getting any leg drive up
into it anymore and that's you know
maybe a sign of a little bit of a cramp
but definitely tired and no leg drive
here he's going to have to set himself
early in the fifth isn't he and uh just
see if he can produce a couple of good
games early
third
15 I was down on the court Rob I didn't
see how close that Ace was on Match
Point was it on the
line outside of the
line okay they didn't give
us you know zoom in on it but it pretty
close to the line I want to say on the
line
yeah it's a game of inches well it's
actually a game of millimeters really
mhm tell you his his average first surve
speed is down almost 15 km an
hour 1 14
and this would enable medev to serve
first in the fifth the few breaks here
[Applause]
that
[Applause]
is
okay SP
just waiting for the balls to come
down okay chance to take us into the
fifth
15 well other is completely saving
himself now for the fifth or or he is
really
struggling I'm just keeping a close eye
on him had a camera shot
3 that might
be one of the few times that danil has
actually hit a second serve
there normally goes with a
slider TI has negated at the whole match
pretty much until now
[Applause]
14 the bounce back ability from meddev
has been
admirable chance to take us into a fifth
game and for the fifth time in a row at
the Australian Open medv will contest a
five Setter he wins the
[Applause]
fourth out being
[Applause]
L 15 off
this is where you start to
go to a dark place in your mind where
you got to learn to suffer and you've
got to learn to enjoy the
suffering 30
[Music]
[Applause]
15 f
well to me I I feel like he's got to win
this first game the trend will be or the
die might be
cast I'm always worried when a
player almost doesn't care about a set
of tennis like that four set he's just
lost the range on the forehand it could
have been an opportunity to to try and
Claw something back
there but I'm willing to forgive him for
that because he he's such a young player
he he hasn't been here much his life
you're right you know and uh he he
probably is hurting here
physically certainly not serving as fast
consistently at
it but it can be a dangerous thing to do
you're right Robbie I I've always
believed that that that really sets a
tone for the fifth set
[Applause]
and you sometimes you can't get the
momentum back
yep really does need to steady the ship
here get his nose out in
front he'll feel a whole lot better
about himself
out I think we're now we're going to see
Med pev try to spread the court there at
forehand going outside The Singles Line
he going to try to move TI
yes gave that one a
wallet
out no doubt it's missing
even if you put the fourth set out of
your
mind he wasn't missing in the first
three sets like this
[Applause]
outch
guys from this angle I could just see
the extra shape that Med was trying to
put on the forehand tried to go into
lock down mode to try to get learner
Tenn see if he would make a mistake but
learner tenen dug deep there as you said
Robie went into a dark Blaze and said I
don't care if every muscle in my body
hurts I'm going to find a way right
now how can the previous RAR count the
same is
that don't ask difficult questions at
this time of night Rob I mean come on
Robbie it's too late to ask that
question it's not right
out
[Music]
yes e
Gotti guys from down here that ball blew
up like a waterm it was so big that it
was so hard for these guys to find pace
and after that point Med videt just
stared over at learner Tian as if to say
okay I think you maybe still have some
legs he was testing him out
there I think that body
language was telling us though that he
was hurting there
oh gutsy game gutsy game from the
youngster cuz he got five more of those
in
him first
[Applause]
well the patience is
back the accuracy is there the shot
tolerance is
there I learner tn's got to do exactly
what he did there at the end when he win
that game he put his hand in the air and
try to get this crowd behind him I think
he needs a little bit of energy
something else that comes from side
himself at this
point to just grab that extra energy cuz
medev doesn't look tired at all maybe
that looks like he could do this all
night
[Music]
long plays a good game of poker though
does daniil it's been a couple of times
I can
remember r on one occasion he was
cramping after the three sets of tennis
but he hit it so well it actually might
have even been here need to double check
that I remember him struggling to get
off the bench to go and do the postmatch
interview I think it was with Jim Jim
Courier we had no idea until the match
was over
out 15
[Applause]
L 3
[Applause]
I apologize it was the blue courts of
Miami against Alexi poin is the match
I'm thinking
of 4 love
[Applause]
F 14 15
[Applause]
still not the longest match that Tien
has played in his career it will be the
previous round that went 3 hours and 56
minutes I wonder if he worked as hard
though certainly looked like
it out
14 sets were close F 46 76 6 three
57
64 a lot of tennis being played there
maybe it's a cumulative effect as well
yes trying to recover
out
one and of course the wind predictor has
been swinging violently at H
lar big Underdog at the start of the
match Adam big favorite two sets to love
up now he
is not quite back where he started but
certainly the big underdog
a dick 5 one of the shots in that rally
was just breathtaking how good it is
but he still seems to possess the fire
power when he gets to the ball it's it's
whether he's as balanced as he was
earlier he's spraying more balls I think
because he's out of position
whereas out he can still generate the
racket head speed can't he oh yeah
pretty important game for him
there
please yeah nice comfortable hold it's
21
across Europe remember it's not just the
destination also
time
well day five of this year's Australian
Open started at 11:30
a.m. and it has been going
strong it's almost 2 a.m. local time
here in Melbourne and those who have
stuck around to watch this
contest have been well
rewarded because the drama has built
nicely
and I
can't sorry Robie you could almost say
that this is two days of entertainment
right here talk about good value for
money always like a bit of
that
and learn Tien had a match point in that
third set tie break this guy served his
13th ace at that very
moment here we are
I just wonder who the new balls are
going to help
here yeah and how much it might tempt
them to go for a little bit more and get
a quick Point see well I think so I
think there'll be more quick points one
way or the
other what twist is left here
[Applause]
oh that must have caught the outside
edge throwing a big risky serve wide
F oh clever
went behind the California and and no
doubt he's having more trouble moving
and changing direction yeah and that's
what we had talked about earlier on in
the match just maybe going behind such a
fast player lak learner ten smart there
from
medev out
showing some guts right now though not
moving as well but he is going through
the pain barrier you would think
those those thighs would be burning you
would
imagine an early break point
one
out game wow I honestly didn't see
that that break of serve coming didn't
see
it that
changes the scenario big time because
suddenly TI can now see their checked
flag in the
distance well guys right now I'm texting
with Rodney Marshall the fitness trainer
that he worked with for an entire month
so it was Alex mikkelson learner Tenn
for one month and Carson competing
against each other every Saturday they
had Beach workouts this guy was digging
in the sand for four Saturdays straight
to be ready for moments like this
I mean how good are this guy's soft
skills 5 such good hands and one another
thing that Rodney said he said you know
a lot of players take holidays off these
guys were training on Thanksgiving Day
in the states they wanted to be prepared
for the Heat and moments and p sets in
Australia
f
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
temptation to get impatient and want to
quick cold here is so
great finding a little bit of energy
though this is where the big servers can
get a few free ones
[Applause]
oh
[Applause]
[Music]
13 it's just a battle of
Will and
[Applause]
willpower another break point for denil
f
we back on serve in the fifth and this
now officially becomes the longest match
that t learner TI has ever played in his
[Music]
career all right it's time to put your
hands together and get ready to game set
clap let's
go this is too easy let's go
faster we need more energy than this F
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
definitely some chat going on in the
camp but don't how much is getting to
denal time
previous round 3 hours and 56 minutes
for learner
TI
against C Ugo Carabelli of Argentina
I can tell you that's still way short of
the longest match anal Med has ever
played it was incidentally here and it
was in a final against Raphael Nadal
remember when he was up two sets to love
ended up losing that one 5 hours 24
minutes that one LED
out love
[Applause]
13
[Applause]
up 4 C 15
[Applause]
oh wonderful forehand finish a head 405
takes more of a
risk level
again what a play for
now it's going to be hard for either of
these two you would
imagine to recover after this what a
marathon it's what it takes to win a
major you have to win seven matches
they're just in the second Robbie
I meant seven rounds I think I said
seven Majors it's getting it's getting
late at night but seven rounds you have
to win
here we knew what you're were talking
about only in the second this is brutal
that's why they're so highly valued
[Music]
well guys I don't know how deep Danny
medev can go into his memory bank right
now but last year in his second round he
played a m r sori i was commentating
that match into the postmatch interview
at 4:30 in the morning so we're only at
2 in the morning right now so he's got a
two and a half hours more to get to
where he was last year and he still made
the final so lot of effort these guys
are putting out here right now
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
too
[Applause]
good excuse me I'm going to correct
myself real quick on medev it wasn't
till 4:30 it was till 3:39 in the
morning 4 hours and 23 minutes in the
second round last year what's 40 minutes
between friends
[Laughter]
[Music]
here
W what an angle short
across almost can't put the ball away
like they were earlier in the match the
the power's gone from both of
them but they're still steady as a rock
not missing created a little extra angle
there that was good enough
[Music]
t a patient hold from TM
[Music]
he's back out in front to lead 43
[Music]
[Music]
sure
what car are stucking up on but Daniel's
having a problem getting that one
open trying to get something into him as
soon as he possibly
can he spent the whole change of
ends trying to get the lid off
well we've had some long
matches and we' had some late finishes
here in Australia but who could ever
forget I think it was on this court as
well Andy
Mur taking on tenasi konakis that was
an absolute Battle
[Applause]
Royale 5 minutes past 4 in the morning
is when it finished
[Music]
[Applause]
15
L guys after that after Lear Tien got
that hold and he was walking to the
bench he kind of put his arms in the air
to get the crowd involved and medv saw
that and he kind of mocked him did the
same thing to the crowd so there's a
little mind game going on as well from
medev
[Applause]
for
[Applause]
love f
[Applause]
14 a shot that has caused M of a lot of
problems this evening especially in the
opening two
sets so often in the the back quarter of
that
court it's a Well struck forand it's not
the fastest forehand
on tour that's for sure he averages
about 122 km an
hour top 10 forand average is 126 so
he's just below
that out tell you what is impressive is
his depth on
it four games on course if you've got
the depth that ball stays in the air a
little
longer moment it hits the courtt that's
when it slows up dramatically so every
inch or yard or meter that you can keep
that ball in the air
is it's just worth so much get to the
other side of the court so quickly
[Music]
there it
is bang on yet again
I mean this guy is an absolute genius
with the ball you're talking about depth
on the ball as far as inches are concern
but how about the inches of effort as
well just to work as hard as you
possibly can and try to outwork your
opponent learner TN finding the depth
there on that shot
[Applause]
it's almost in a way at this point in
the match the game plan almost goes out
the window becomes more about who wants
it more at this moment
[Music]
out
1
[Applause]
[Music]
15 I can tell you we've already had 11
matches that have gone over four
[Music]
hours this year's Australian
Open this is the
12th
14 seed the line
14 1
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
high quality match high quality service
game after 4 hours and 13 minutes it's
54 in the 5th
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
takes another step
closer to getting the W this
evening I can tell you that ber really
has been studying concentration you let
things go in the four set it must be
said I think he was disappointed after
having a match
point in the third set tie break pev
delivered an ace at 67 to Snuff it out
quickly but he's regrouped
nicely can't tell you that 10 was up a
break early stages of this fifth set but
danal bounced back
beautifully that was to make it 3-2 back
on surf and no breaks since
[Music]
then out oh he tempted
him
15 yeah I'm starting to hear a few more
screeches and footwork back here from
learner Tenn just a few more small steps
to get in position for these shots
good look at there
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
1 15
[Applause]
CL we had
out
fur both
players with a couple the cheap errors
in this
game yeah one thing I've noticed from
learner TM is he's picked up the pace on
his forehand so the forehands coming
with with more Pace then slice back
hands there's actually a few raindrops
that are falling on top of me right
now see what that holds
up no
way that is is
[Music]
outrageous and unreal volley and you
know what I like seeing from that one
too after the volley the coach of
learning TM Eric Diaz had a smile on his
face to say you know what that's just
too good
[Music]
what
it's
Magnificent the cour
cross the
Artistry five games on improved his
position in the rally incrementally with
each
shot and then
finished with a flourish off his beloved
backand he can do anything off that
Wing how good were those l two
points
[Music]
Pall 15 l
both guys just showing so much heart
right now they know how important every
single point is at this point at five
allall in the fifth
out Robbie just going to throw it out
there it's starting to sprinkle down
here on the court come on come on like
uh they might have to stop because it's
starting to come down pretty
quick no
way it's
[Music]
unbelievable the roof is quite far open
so they're going to need to hustle
yeah it's going to have to happen quick
cuz it's a pretty steady drizzle that's
going on right now and that goes on for
another four to five minutes this
Court's going to take a little bit to uh
to dry
up I I'm surprised they
haven't made a calculated decision just
to close it anyway given that there's
not a lot of time left yeah I'm looking
at the roof right now it's definitely
staying open they haven't started
it oh now it's moving so just now
started the moving to get it
closed yeah this is
unfortunate for Lerner because it's his
service game and I always think Nick get
a little easier perhaps when you
returning in these moments given there
there's such a premium there's so much
value on serving and holding holding
serve right yeah know absolutely and if
I'm learner Tenn you know I'm probably
even going to hit you know maybe a
couple serves once it kind of gets close
to being closed and you know you're
going to start playing again just you
know cuz they're having a an extended
break to sit down here and it's good you
know get a little hydration get some
some food in the system if you can but
you don't want to get too cold sitting
down Nick I don't know how many of the
the other youngsters you have
seen play this week this Australian Open
the likes of fona menic Faria did his
match yesterday
evening we see
larner what have you enjoyed and who's
stood out for you this performance how
do you compare it to say fona against
rev yeah I mean look vona is just
incredible right you know I was looking
at some some of the statistics for him
through his qualifying run here and you
know he had an average four-and speed of
82 mph which was third at the Australian
Open through qualies I mean he he he
excuse me third through everyone in the
Australian Open I mean the guy has a
massive forehand was on a 14 match win
streak um you know he's he's an
impressive player and as Carlos alarz
says I mean that that guy's going to be
in the top 10 very
soon and we see the ball kids out here
wiping off the court
trying to help out the players but yeah
learn TN I mean look you know he's he's
been a winner right he's been a winner
ever since he was a junior you know we
talked about how and uh the boys 18 and
under kalamazo national championships
and if you win that you end up going to
the US Open and he won that as a
16-year-old he won it as a 17-year-old
didn't even have to play it as an
18-year-old because he was winning
Challengers to already get enough points
to get a wild card in the US Open so he
knows how to win right and it's one of
those things where you know maybe he
doesn't have the biggest serve at the
moment and maybe might not ever have the
biggest serve of the moment but what he
does have is a big heart and he
understands how to move the ball around
the court and you don't always have to
have the biggest Strokes if you have a
big heart and you know the geometry of a
tennis court yeah his tennis
intelligence and we've seen it tonight
firstand Haven win it
against you know one of one of the great
Geniuses of our game when it comes to
shot selection and out maneuvering
opponents yeah I mean Danny Mev is not
used to somebody out foxing him
right and and there for two sets learner
Tien was out foxing the fox and then you
know in the four set obviously got maybe
a little tired and now some of the
adrenaline has kicked in for learner TN
but it just shows you how good he is and
how good these players are I mean learn
coming in 112 in the world you know and
people not knowing his name and I
guarantee you they're going to know his
name regardless win or lose of this
match and you know it just shows the
depth of the game it shows how hard
these guys are working in the offseason
in and you know it's been on full
display here tonight yeah and and I
mentioned fona there particularly cuz
they've had some some good matches they
played in the the finals of the next gen
in Saudi fona came out on top they
played the finals of the junior event at
the US Open fona came out on top so he's
trending perhaps just a little bit ahead
of lunner but I tell you what lunner
gets the win tonight and
and it' be fascinating to watch how
their respective careers you know unfold
I guess parallel to one another for for
the next 10 15 years no that's for sure
and I'll just give a quick shout out to
Lear TN right now he just clapped for
all the ball kids for coming out you
know they came out and DED the court and
he started clapping his hands just such
a nice guy he is but you know I
completely agree with you you you better
believe you learnard TN heard Carlos
alcarez talk about how great of a career
fona is going to have and and Lear tn's
probably thinking to himself hey man I'm
one of those guys too I can hang with
that guy I've played against him and I
and I know how to you know potentially
beat that guy and so he's got to believe
within himself that he can do it and he
also as we said he trains with Alec M
Mickelson and you know melson's been
been playing so well you know inside the
top 45 so he's you know he's got to
believe it hey I'm right there with the
big boys and that belief system has been
on display here tonight and now they're
going to be back playing
well
this this is when it really
comes between the ears big time the
mental toughness and I think especially
so for
[Applause]
Lerner yeah I love how learner's already
stepped up to the line medev just
walking back but leer says let's get
this show on the road I'm ready to go
five all in the fifth 15 all
[Music]
oh he's made
it by
millimeters yeah we saw such great shape
on the forehand from medev on the
crosscourt down the line but that one
just flattening it out
out 15 14 you got to be so careful if we
go to m but's back in too many times in
a row so good at working the ball around
the court with that
[Applause]
shot and a valuable break point
now let's
he's got the break
he's something special this guy how has
he turned this one around they'll Sur it
[Music]
oh
[Music]
time what an effort what a Monumental
effort this has
been I'm a big fan of marathan running
I'm a big fan of the legendary Elliot
kogi and I love that line of his at the
apex of the pain that's where success
is Med's right there serving for the
match
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
it's just amazing how calm meev stays
right now in this moment 4 hours and 32
minutes in just using a short angle
crosscourt and a and a backhand
crosscourt just moving learner T in as
much as he can so patient
spank you very
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
much the pace of lonner tn's forehand
has picked up over these last two or
three games so much on the line and he's
going going for it even
more jaw dropping
[Applause]
stuff just make sure you got a soft
place for your jaw to land
when you watch
this 15

his heart right now and remembering
those Beach workouts that he had
throughout the preseason every Saturday

four a forward did so in the early
stages
of that third set try to change things
up and he's come up with a crucial
volley yet again yeah what he's done so
well on the volley he's been following
his approach shots really well and
getting close to the net that's help him
make the volley
3
2 it's just
Fearless has not held back all
match trusting his
technique and decision making
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
let
[Applause]
what a second
serve I mean how much curve did that
serve have on it hit the forehand from
the douche side to learnard
Tien incredible to go for that small
space cuz that's what lean's making him
do is go for that small Target by
standing where he where he was let's
go let go let go
course M have so much experience in
these kind of situations playing big
matches long
matches he's played in Major
finals he will have the belief that this
is where it comes in for
lunner and in any honest accounting
training is the case in belief is the
icing and sometimes that thin smear of
frosting can make all the difference
[Music]
[Music]
out oh beware the backand beware the
backand
for
[Applause]
three it's 106 rallies now that they've
had nine plus shots
oh and I just love that play from
learner TI there wide serve using his
Lefty wide serve to get meev outside the
court to really open it up meev knew he
was going to have a long ways to run if
he didn't hit that return well
out five
four just occasionally he gets a little
too much air on the backand
slice yeah that one just didn't you know
it's late in the match 4 hours and 42
minutes in just didn't keep his feet
moving was stretching for that ball
there got to give everything you have
for these last few points
[Applause]
64 together
[Applause]
[Music]
you
genius to have the presence of
mind to choose that shot and hit it as
well as
this Robbie I believe that's the first
drop shot that we've seen off of that
forehand Wing we've seen so much Pace
coming off the forehand and redirection
that's why Med didn't even move for that
one unbelievable disguise
[Music]
[Music]
6 just a
brutal Gladiator combat disguised as a
tennis match that's what this is was
what do Jimmy Conners used to say boxing
at 90
ft I mean these two guys are going
through all the pain in the world and
saying you know what I'm not going to
give in tonight not tonight you know
we've seen these guys eating their gels
different energy drinks whatever they
can to survive right now at 2:51 in the
morning Mel time leaving the heart on
the

court how as danal medb kept that return
in the court
[Applause]
here
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]

go Cross Court throughout this match and
that's why learner Tenn just started
running for it throughout five sets of
tennis he's seen that a few times
teen with more
magic and
