please take any seat for now ready for
play wind will be a factor
see that flag right there the one thing
about this stadium because the bowl is
so deep wherever the flag is kind of
going that's not where the wind is going
down the bottom of the bowl the wind is
trapped by the stadium that comes down
and sweeps in
and pulls the other way so you've got to
actually see it the other way ready
women's
final yesterday the near court was the
tough court
[Applause]
to wait and see but that could have been
wind aided
[Music]
already an early approach off the
backhand side
nobody djokovic not allowing that ball
to get up above his shoulder so he
drives the approach out but he misses
the finishing volley
um
[Music]
it's fascinating for a while djokovic
was the architect of the point then the
doll exercised his strength
the second time he hits it long
uh
[Music]
early jitters for both players
[Applause]
not only have they met 37 times look but
look at this
they're all big matches semifinals
quarterfronts finals finals finals
finals
davis cup
you see not a lot of power off of the
joke of its racket but
great placement he takes the ball early
notice where he's hitting that ball from
from the baseline or just inside he goes
towards the ball so he doesn't allow the
dow time to recover and set up his
defensive position
and then he places it into a corner or
close to a sideline
[Applause]
middle of rush hour on a monday expect
the same thing
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
and one of the things that you must do
as a player when you're playing in windy
conditions you've got to bring in your
margins bring in your targets
play with top spin
to bring the ball back down when you're
with the win and you've got to take top
spin off the ball drive through the wind
the flatter ball
30 dollars
it was queen sophia from spain
she gets a lot of tax money from the
goal
you see the way djokovic
is trying to move nadal side to side and
really put him on the run
as much as possible as early in the
rally as possible
it's three balls looks for the two of
the newest of the three
newer balls will travel faster through
the air give you a little bit more bite
and jump
be quicker on your server
[Music]
[Applause]
by the way we talked about it last match
you see the wrist watch that nadal is
wearing
especially designed to absorb the torque
and the pounding that he delivers
to it by serving and playing the way he
does you can have one
for six hundred and ninety thousand
dollars
will i play like him if i feel playing
best you'll be on time
[Applause]
a big winner to throw a little maybe
into this game
uh
luke this is one of those matches where
a service breaker seemed cataclysmic
it's interesting because jokingly tried
kind of a tricky first game and now the
doll
kind of squandered two game points and
now the fans are into it i mean
everybody is electrified
for this final and this is kind of the
first
kind of
big point
even though it's very early in the match
[Applause]
coach
[Applause]
serbia and there was a documentary made
it was really touching he took a
trophy from one of his big wins back to
her in her home this is the wimbledon
trophy i think it was yeah
[Applause]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
wow if you're watching that live you
cannot believe how much that spun to be
in and good
luck
gets around the outside see this is the
cross court now watch this down the line
it goes outside and then
obviously hooks back in
with so much swirly wind i mean that's
so hard to do
to drop it in that corner
uh
[Music]
[Applause]
fifteen
[Applause]
oh
second search
uh
i love that play
one of the things you can do against
very
solid extremely solid baseliners is as
soon as you get a short ball like this
you explode the open court and then it's
as soon as you see that slice backhand
gonna pop up you follow it in
and take it on either a punch volley
like that or a swinging volley
to put more juice behind it
but you've got to be able to be
you've got to have the ability to see
the situation develop
and then close on
three shaky games out i mean
[Music]
i get the feeling joke twitch is trying
to force the issue a little bit more
he's been to the net a couple of times
nadal hasn't yet
[Music]
here we go
a great point
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
[Applause]
um
[Applause]
how about that sneaker
there's uncle tony
he's the guy who really was the
architect
of rafa's game
making him play left-handed first as a
two-hander on both sides like monica
sellers
and then bringing the
second hand off so he has a one-handed
[Music]
and that was very strange because
didn't even go for that shot
he was kind of stuck in the middle of
the court his legs are not moving look
at this
he didn't even try for
here's the wind-up look how he gets
underneath the ball and the massive
finish
up around his head
uh
[Applause]
one more time a break point
you can hear the sound of all those
cameras clicking
the point of the serve especially for a
moment like this six and a half minutes
for this single game
uh
and a service break that feels like a
very big deal
17 minutes into the first set
now how does djokovic react here
how does he respond
it seems like nadal has been a little
bit cleaner with his
with his ground strokes a little bit
more sure of what he's trying to do out
here
and i wonder if djokovic has any kind of
hangover from the semi-final played on
saturday that four hour nine minute
marathon
[Music]
lovely
[Applause]
at one point in the fifth set they had a
21
minute game
that he lost they lost
[Music]
13 deuces in that game
ah
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
yeah just mistimed it i mean he is not
he is not really as consistent
as he really wants to be right now
considering the strength of his opponent
there is a helicopter
flying over the stadium
and i mean right over the stadium and
slowly
[Music]
[Applause]
so djokovic was ahead
30 love
[Music]
future
what an aggressive shot by djokovic yeah
he really put himself in good position
there the serve was kind of general in
nature and he pivots watch this
explosion right through the strike zone
and when you're returning like that you
pick your target out where you want to
go with it before your opponent serves
so you've already have your targeting
set in your mind what you want to do
with the ball then sometimes it changes
depending on the quality of the surf but
in that case it was so
it was right there in his wheelhouse
[Music]
[Music]
yeah and there's nadal being the
aggressor he's hitting the ball harder
he's hitting the ball with better depth
and placement
and djokovic is he's frustrated because
he's not doing anything with the ball
he's just being that counter puncher and
eventually
the muscle prevails
[Music]
27 shots in the rally
great stuff he thought they could do it
all night long
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
djokovic is doing a lot of staring at
his box
a lot of questioning what he's doing out
there
he talked about a hangover from the last
match he was pretty inconsistent in that
match with favrenka
avrika was the guy who had a little bit
better footwork a little bit better
firepower but he just didn't have enough
experience to get it past the finish
line
usopen.org is the place to find out how
you can follow this event via twitter
and facebook plus shopping check out all
the highlights and press conferences
usopen.org
now if you're nadal you put a lot of
emphasis in this game you've got the guy
cut on his heels right now kind of
emotionally backing up
and second guessing himself
and if you can sneak out another break
to go up double break in this first set
that really sends a message for this
final
[Music]
[Applause]
pretty large
[Applause]
second of the match
[Applause]
now you have to strike that way
[Music]
well they're both their first serve
percentage is down and the one key is
that
when nadal gets his first serve and he's
winning 80 percent of those points when
djokovic gets it in he's only winning 58
he's not getting the
ball back that he really needs to take
control of the point the short ball a
convincing haul by novak djokovic he's
still down a
serve in the opening set
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
please
[Music]
division
[Applause]
rafael nadal scampering onto the court
making his towel delivery up a break in
the first set
of the men's singles championship at the
2013 u.s open
[Applause]
both men serving at about the same rate
122 123 miles an hour
ah
um
[Music]
[Applause]
15 though
he's really zipping it in there 119
miles an hour and that's against a
little bit of wind
up until the semis he he hadn't dropped
his serve at all
so it's been extremely effective
throughout this tournament and this big
one he's had
winning three major
hardcore tournaments
indian wells which is in the spring
canadian open up in montreal and
cincinnati just a couple of weeks before
the open
on the same surface as the us open what
do you think the look on his face when
he finally had his serve broken here was
like what just happened
oh
and look at how delicate those drop
shots and angles were so many times you
think of the power of the modern game
these players can also play with a lot
of touch
per second
here's the short angle so he lets it
drop just a little bit and cuts it
just to the outside to get that angle
look at it right here boom
they're like dancers these two
11 unforced arrows for djokovic fall for
nadal to me nadal is letting the match
come to him
going at djokovic
match
[Applause]
that's the highlight
this was the big shot the overhead just
didn't get away from the standard and
then look at this just a flick of the
wrist this time it has a little top spin
on it what i'm concerned with al is that
djokovic is kind of watching
you know he's not reacting to those
little shots those little angles he's
not getting his racket on the ball he's
reaching for
[Applause]
and it's almost like blood in the water
from nadal here in the first set he's up
a break 4-2
love 30 on djokovic's serve he can
really put
his hands around djokovic's throat right
now
by getting a big forehand in play
uh
[Music]
it wasn't big but it was an angle
we're not used to seeing joke of it but
there's bombs in the air pleadingly
looking at his box in the first set of
anything
arthur ashe stadium is just about full
now and everybody can feel what's
happening here they can feel this set
slipping away from joke
[Applause]
it sure did seem like it carried just a
little bit didn't it
let's watch it all together
it was out
and now he'll be serving for the first
set
dowell just had
a little bit more bite
in his approach a little bit more
focus
easy to say now with a double break
but you're looking for those little
wrinkles those little signs
[Music]
i'm never a big fan when djokovic starts
pleading with his box to give him
something
to go to
um
look at him
[Applause]
ah
[Applause]
15.
[Music]
uh
[Applause]
you saw hints of that in the
beginning of this match
then he just kind of lost it a little
bit just kind of went off the rails
how about that charge i mean when was
the last time you saw the dow just
hit a ground stroke and then just charge
in it really wasn't
one of these approachable balls but he
right he's along the baseline he
recognizes that he's
got the ball with some pace in the
corner but boy that's a dangerous play
and i think he actually surprised
djokovic a little bit because
it really wasn't the shot to come in
especially
you know at set point
normal shortball you see
the doll handle gets up to with his
forehand and he rips it to a corner
[Applause]
ah
uh
[Applause]
takes the first set
convincingly at 6-2
in 42 minutes
which is a key opportunities
to break and then running it with it
with his serve
one match-up is that you know the no
novak joker's return to serve is the
best in the world you talk to anyone who
plays
against these guys guys in the locker
room
who's just day in day out
this is the guy djokovic is the guy who
just returned
[Music]
he ran around to a big forehand and that
was a difference
joe fish kind of lost his footing just a
little bit
[Music]
and the dynamics change a little bit
before djokovic you cannot afford to
play against this physical beast look at
the concern on martin vida's face
the coach of novak djokovic
you down to sets the love against this
monster of a competitor of an athlete
i mean that's an uphill battle
for a joke of it you can really try to
take advantage of this set and maybe
take some more
chances by the unisphere just outside of
the picture there upper right
[Music]
there's the wind holding that ball up
we saw that a ton with serena williams
they set their feet to strike the ball
and all of a sudden the ball is no
longer where you thought it was going to
be
and the wind just holds it up the nuts
enough where you're reaching for it and
you're off balance
set for that shot
we take feedback the polish pistol
played in the 70s and 80s
against mcenroe v loss and connors had a
big win over guillermo velas here
on grandstand court back in the day
it's a big art dealer in poland
[Music]
[Music]
it's a big hole now that's a massive
hole for the
serve when uncle tony doesn't travel
he's got guys who actually played big
time pro tennis kind of in his ear just
giving him thoughts and ideas and angles
on
other parts of his game
djokovic just brought in todd martin at
one time as a consultant look at that
[Applause]
they're always looking to get better
they're always looking for another
approach if this can help
and it may not be relevant
this map or that match but you just kind
of store it into the i'm learning more
about the game every single day
[Music]
trying to come back
[Applause]
that's why he was looking at his box
before i brought you here to help me now
help me
ah
uh
[Music]
[Music]
the dow just exploded
i mean he took this forehand
and took it to 11. i mean if the gauge
is at 10 he just took it one extra step
and then blew up the overhead that thing
was in the president's look at this
and he comes in and look at the venom
that's just me
[Music]
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
please do not call out during the
service motion or during the points
thank you yeah
he just hears the fans either cutting
the balls close to the line some people
are streaming out
well that's how you play enough here
you've got to block that out that's
going to happen
that's a new york crowd they're sports
fans here i mean they they
they're not necessarily
fans
they are following the
fever the action the passion of the
competition and they're involved
see that that's wrong
if he doesn't like the call he should be
able to challenge it right there see how
he did the walk up to the fans are
giving it to you
see right there djokovic is going off by
the slice back and just a little change
up
of pace and spin
of fujokovic's backhand off
[Applause]
ah
um
[Music]
and i don't know why djokovic isn't even
trying
to go after this passing shot he comes
up to the net here
and look at this he's just watching that
go by now i understand that's a that's a
nice little passing shot but to be
standing there and allow it to get the
easy pass
toll pass and let you know what i mean
it's just
for the guy who returns everything yeah
you've got to make that window smaller
make your opponent feel that those gaps
at the net those passing shots are going
to be very tough to get
past you
you can't be standing there watching
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
and he's just not taking the small
adjustment steps watch this backhand
from this angle see how he's just kind
of stuck
the ball gets in on him he steps in but
the first step is so big with his right
foot watch as he steps in then it jams
him
he just plays it wide what a turnaround
in this game
the doll off his back foot
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh
that is not your normal novak joke pitch
nadal just tossed that 185 miles an hour
and he hit it three feet wide
unless it was the change
up aspect of it yeah change up but also
remember the wind i think
the doll seems to be playing better
just from timberlake so many celebrities
that jessica beal
sean connery
is in here in the house dicaprio
jessica alba
there's james bond
that's our guy that's our
right right in our wheelhouse alec
baldwin
he's going over strategy right now for
djokovic
alec baldwin just talking about x's and
house
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
love it
[Applause]
ah
[Applause]
1500
ah
[Music]
all right
than at any other time in the tournament
why would he be doing that i just think
he respects the ball striking ability of
djokovic
and just wants to throw another look
another pace a different type of ball
remember a slice
shot will stay low and skid it will not
bounce up
[Applause]
to finish the point but it really was
this shot recognition and noticed that
the dow was going to slice this up
as a defensive shot just to get himself
some time to get back into the point
djokovic wisely takes it out out of the
air does not let the ball bounce
does not allow the doll back
djokovic needed a point and a game like
this
leads two games to one 2-1 second set
[Music]
um
[Music]
he runs around to another big forehand
ah
[Music]
uh
[Applause]
it's good
was a little vulnerable
[Music]
so he's got the forehand and the
backhand dialed in right now
23 shots
[Applause]
nadal with the surprising approach to
the net
exceptional cross-court
[Applause]
[Applause]
it was out
[Music]
[Applause]
that was a very impressive game
and again the longer rally
favors the spaniards has two challenges
remaining
remember usopen.org is where you can
find everything that is the us open
you can find out how to follow the event
on twitter and facebook you can shop you
can watch and listen and read
usopen.org
is showing all signs of anxiety
[Applause]
they sit from an adult
[Music]
second
dirty thousand
oh
[Music]
[Applause]
his right foot is on the baseline and
it's almost like a roger federer kind of
pickup look at this doesn't back up he
holds his ground bends his knees in a
little short hop
with that top spin
for a winner
[Music]
[Applause]
there just are no free points
every point djokovic wins doesn't it
seem like it's just this big battle
he serves it up and it's his long
drawn-out rally
[Applause]
third ace of the match
and drunk eventually against
3-2 advantages
[Applause]
15
crowd backing up djokovic they want to
see an epic
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
come fifteen
[Applause]
lobe the baseline this is how you do it
get underneath the ball see how he
brushes up the back side of the ball
very difficult in the wind
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
third deal
[Applause]
ah
[Music]
[Music]
very smart follow here
30-40 as soon as he notices
nadal goes and sliced back and he knows
that slice is going to float so he comes
up
instead of hitting a deep volley a punch
volley where mcdowell likes to kind of
hit his passing shots it's the short
angle that pays off
that's great point stats
rich has not been able to convert one
this one will bring the house down
ah
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
that was awesome
54 shots
there was so much in that point out
there were slices and drives and big
forehands and defensive shots
and right at the end the dow gave it one
massive forehand
djokovic got it back
nadal wasn't prepared for it and made
the air after 54
shots
[Applause]
the best point i've seen
in this tournament i mean think about
that break point you're down a set
you have got to come up with something
i love to think
[Applause]
now
is the crowd pulling so hard for
djokovic because he lost the first set
or is it that nadal complained about the
game
i think it's the first part i think they
just want to see a set of piece they
want to see a five-setter these are two
champions at this event here
[Applause]
oh 30.
[Applause]
flag is still blowing
almost straight out
[Music]
lovely
much for momentum
nobel with three chances to break right
back
[Applause]
thank you
[Applause]
it's a big time volley off a big time
powerful
forehand passing shot
boom
and you've got to have a firm grip and a
firm wrist to handle look at the racket
as it bounces off look at it see it just
shocks it
he just tries to maintain enough
stability
so he has control to put it over the net
oh
[Music]
30 40.
they want him to win this set they don't
want him to go down two sets to love
[Music]
uh
it's a tough one for djokovic to take
back-to-back service brakes
15 though
fantasy
it's a nice little passing shot
fifth
coming up to that backhand volley even
if he made it djokovic was all over that
he hit the first passing shot and
started sprinting to the net expecting
the drought volley off the backhand side
[Music]
i really hope
the junior players at home are really
watching this
extraordinary groundstroke play and then
the ability to see look at that flag
[Music]
what a scene
22 000 plus
but how as soon as they get their
opponent on the defensive both of them
are tearing off to the net to finish it
off in the front court
that is really
not seen by today's younger players what
the top players do off their big ground
strokes
um
[Applause]
he just slipped a little bit you know
what because he got down low 30.
remember that he broke and then got
lost two quick points
and got himself into a hole
with two easy unforced errors
uh
40 30.
[Applause]
[Music]
boy is that a big forehand it started
with the return
second serve 85 miles an hour
right in the middle of the box with
really no direction on it
and djokovic takes advantage he steps
back just a little bit seatball right in
his strike zone about waist height
and tags it
uh
[Applause]
hey
[Applause]
ah
[Applause]
riding this emotional roller coaster one
minute he's pumping his fist like right
after this point
and the previous point he's chewing
himself out and yelling at his box
which you don't see very no and it just
shows you the amount of pressure that he
has on himself and what
pressure nadal is putting out there's
just pressure all around this match
right now so much on the line
i mean the year-end number one ranking
they just it's personal up in montreal
djokovic was at the net and the doll
took a passing shot and put it right in
his face
hitting the doll in the i mean hit
djokovic in the face i mean there's a
lot of intrigue going on here
and a battle for this second set
you're always making decisions out there
and choices
you take it out of the air
with the windy conditions
he elects to let this ball drop he sets
up picks his target gets underneath it
the dog guesses the wrong way
[Applause]
please
the fact that he can do that and put it
in is unbelievable
deuce
[Applause]
right there a little coaching i don't
know if you noticed that he looked up to
his box that's uncle tony who chirps a
lot
has been called in the past for coaching
violations
coaches are not allowed to
advise from the chair or from their
their box seats
that's his eighth forehand winner
yes
steps up to the ball doesn't wait for it
and drives it with a little bit more
pepper on the ball she was the man in
charge during that one
and remember he can't take more chances
because he's up 4-3
just one game so worst case scenario
gets the four-all so when you're up play
the score
take more chances when you're behind
you've got to be more conservative
advantage
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
it's an interesting challenge
because he's at two challenges remaining
for the set now he's gonna lose another
one
he'll gain one if they go into a
tiebreaker
desperate attempt to try to get out of
this game this really long nine minute
10 second
[Music]
lot of important game to play here in
the second set
[Music]
[Applause]
starting to change sides of the net
mcdowell has really struggled this game
and now break point opportunity for the
serb
chance to serve for the second set
[Music]
ah
[Applause]
that was shocking absolutely shocking in
the middle of that rally
the rip cord the end the point
in the dynamic rally why would you hit
that drop shot at that point
a brain cramp by rafael nadal
there's no reason to hit this shot right
here look how high it goes and it just
sits up
for
djokovic well let's see if there's
momentum after that please ready for
play
28 shots remember we've had a 54 shot
rally
[Music]
for most of the us
rafael nadal serve was unbreakable
twice in one match
just like the last thing
a very early and strange unforced air
and to me that always goes down to focus
and footwork
your attention to detail
take advantage of the momentum you have
right now don't just give a charity
shot or an error back to your opponent
[Applause]
well it's weird because
he's never been a big ace guy but you
know what i mean
he's going against a really good
returner in djokovic he's quick he's not
going to let
the easy one slip by
[Applause]
right now joking which means the
quickest time the best thing you can do
when you're riding this roller coaster
is mentally kind of pull it
together kind of think about what you
want to do with the serve and the second
shot
be patient here you have a 5-3 lead
[Applause]
not so much
[Applause]
[Music]
kokovic has 25 unforced errors nadal
only 11.
i'll tell you that last one number 11.
it could be huge
at 15 30.
[Applause]
thank you
it's going to get loud if he serves an
ace right here wins this
this point and wins the second
uh
[Applause]
66 first serves
for the match kicks it off
ah
[Applause]
there's a look at arthur ashe stadium at
the billie jean king national tennis
center
final grand slam of the year
absolutely
and now at this point of set a piece
you're pulling for your guy
you know they're not pulling for someone
to get even
[Applause]
lean and mean
talking about
ripping it and ripping it he moves to
the side
and he's not he'll take it but there's
no way he was aiming for that short of
an angle we've seen him hit deeper
inside out four hands from that position
here's a little opportunity for
djokovic
the
he's challenging left and right he was
left with one after the towards the end
of the second set
in pro tennis that's
[Music]
[Applause]
we've seen djokovic kind of struggle
with his
mental toughness and his stability and
the dow kind of
in a strange way you know frustrated and
calls for a challenge
it's not even close
there's been a seismic shift
look at vita he was so concerned
about 20 minutes ago and that first
round
has turned upside down how does the dow
respond
how does he pick up his game right here
it starts with the feet
you want to really start using your
forehand a little bit more if you're
nadal
[Music]
nice disguise in the drop shot djokovic
gets all the way up there now he's won
five straight points to start out this
third set
and you see he comes up it looks like
he's going to drive the ball at the last
second see how he just turns the angle
of the racket face right there
nadal has got to respect the deep ball
the drive and so he's on his heels
behind the baseline
six points in a row
and this points aren't even
like close right now they're not long
it's just hit and miss from the spaniard
and if you're djokovic you you stay on
this treadmill right now this ride that
you have
just tied this momentum
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
ace number four
[Applause]
uh
40 30.
[Applause]
[Applause]
ah
you all right
pick their guys
look at the backhand volley the footwork
just isn't there you want to get that
right leg across and step watch us
instead of one big lunge out to the side
you want to try to turn your hips and
get that right foot
across your body and step into that ball
wow
[Applause]
earlier the long rallies favorite nadal
not right now
[Applause]
taking some really deep breaths djokovic
leads him to love he backs up the break
and it's two love in the third
and now the pressure really switches
from the down
the pressure is really on djokovic in
the second and he responded does nadal
respond
he's got to get his serve
more involved in the outcome of these
points he's got to get some
unreturnables maybe a couple of aces
[Music]
15 million
ah
has been so successful
[Applause]
foreign
[Applause]
very important moments for both players
[Applause]
moving in different directions right now
and djokovic can really
solidify his foothold in this third set
by breaking here and going up two breaks
and he is joking just hitting the ball
now i mean he's really laying it in
with some pace
there's the first sign of the juice
there's the first sign of the energy
he knows the moment
it seems like a routine play but at a
massive time and djokovic goes right to
the fist pump he's got to get
emotionally charged up right now
ah
40 30.
[Applause]
oh
oh
nadal's looking at the mark but i he
can't afford to
challenge this right now
[Applause]
look how he steps forward and just whips
across that ball
[Applause]
see it goes forward that that's the key
right there he doesn't let the ball come
to him he gets his body momentum going
into the shot
[Applause]
watch how he just pivots his abbreviated
take back because the pace of the serve
is 114 miles an hour
here's a death blow opportunity for the
serbian
novak djokovic
yes
[Music]
this has turned out to be exactly what
we thought
[Applause]
ah
[Music]
me
it pays off this time and he goes to the
crowd
to draw them in
pull down
to his side enjoy the brilliance of this
drop shot
[Music]
it's almost as if he was tired of the
point
[Applause]
[Music]
almost
he's looking at it
for two hours in
he needed that in a big way
djokovic serving when we come back to
arthur actually you can see how many
people are moving in the crowd
absolutely i mean it's
if you don't make your move early
these games go forever and then
you know a set changeover these guys are
changing their clothes and stuff
sometimes that extends it
[Applause]
jokingly for a little servant volley
play that didn't work
ah
[Applause]
this is the 37th time they've met so
once in a while you need a little
surprise
looks like he's going to drive it and
then he comes off the left hand on the
top part of the handle and it's a
one-hand backhand
backspin drop shot
and when i break these guys down
i really think
djokovic has the better backhand nadal
is the better forehand but in this match
so far djokovic has been the one
especially in the second and third set
with the better forehand he's been
explosive on the return of serve side
and very good in transition
uh
uh
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
another strong game for djokovic to go
up 3-1
djokovic leads three games to one third
sense
we came here it was summertime
leaving its fall
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
you know the dow could just go over to
djokovic and give him his watch and say
how about we call it a night
he almost worth it
i get the million in the bonus
it's just it's a wash
uh
[Applause]
right
i thought his footwork was kind of
sloppy i thought it mentally he was he
was still kind of
trying to find his way and navigate his
way into the match emotionally he was
complaining to his box and his hands
were open and he was constantly
kind of chatting with his team
he's been just zeroed in the last two
sets
seconds
what was
[Applause]
remember called
courts do leave marks
so he's going to the next court so he's
he's guessing this is good yeah
[Applause]
djokovic has two challenges remaining
[Applause]
he doesn't have any aces but that was
just as good as one
just enough pace at 111 miles an hour
with just enough placement
djokovic couldn't handle it
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
oh the pressure just keeps building here
you just see this third set coming down
to just a couple of games and a couple
of defining swings
okay
so three two third set one set of pieces
to two thirds
djokovic serving 3-2
ah
he was perfectly set up for a big winner
and
that happened
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
ah
it worked that time
[Applause]
ah
[Music]
um
[Music]
[Applause]
djokovic struggled in the second set
when he was at the break the first time
he got broken back he was able to pull
it together and run away with the second
nadal's making another run right here
look at how far nadal is back
mcdowell's back here to let the ball
slow down
and kind of come down from its kicking
position the ball kicks up on a
american or what they call a kick serve
a lot of top spin on it
but that puts him so deep in the
baseline behind the baseline
he has to start running
look at the winners in this set luke
it's 11-2
and one of the things everybody's been
talking about is mcdowell's
hardcore fast court game that's been so
much more offensive sticking around the
baseline but i don't think djokovic has
allowed the doll to find that footing to
find that area of the court
and now nadal's going back to his old
defensive stance way back behind the
baseline
he's definitely not making a move
and that's where he needs to pay off
mcdowell really needs to get his
forehand
kind of started up again put some gas
into that shot and ignite it
[Applause]
not quite a seesaw
i mean by the moment
this isn't like a game or two with runs
point to point
both competitors
doing everything they can
it's just so evenly matched just a
moment ago they put up the points 76
apiece
a great point
thank you
[Applause]
uh
[Applause]
up
this is unreal
are just so into this
[Applause]
it is
[Music]
[Applause]
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
but he's being so offensive i mean again
he's going for it yeah he's definitely
going he's got 32 winners on the match
11
in the set
to nadal's two winners
this is on the return of serve
just out
dirty though
ah
ah
that nadal got to that ball in the lower
left-hand corner was unbelievable that's
the speed he's possessed throughout his
career
just that his ability just to get in
that corner but it just wasn't placed
enough on this one and then
overcooks it djokovic
doesn't do enough with the backhand
volley or the swing volley
[Music]
[Applause]
first double fault
of the match for nadal doesn't really
kill him because he's up 40 love
you've seen some double faults
horrible times throughout this
tournament
it's not necessarily
the number but it's wind
another long hit from djokovic
will be serving 3-4 after the changeover
djokovic 3-4
15.
ace number six
[Music]
ah
[Applause]
23 000 people there's always somebody on
the booth
[Applause]
[Music]
wow
the doll's ball just got a little short
in the
[Applause]
djokovic was able to just pivot set
himself and go to the open court
inside out with the forehand
[Music]
oh
uh
[Applause]
in the title match
really isn't a factor right now
a lot of the fans are going up
just buying up the jackets and
sweatshirts
it is getting chilly out there
and the breeze does not help
i think over the years of watching
matches like this the one thing that
really amazes me is the concentration
level oh yeah
there's a layers of laser beam focus but
both competitors have right now you just
block out everything
you are so engaged
with the ball on the other side
djokovic is just as a returner just
staring at that ball studying the toss
yes
it's very hard to do to pull medal up to
the front court
that drop shot behind the baseline and
then this is the payoff see after the
drop shot djokovic moves in to take the
next ball out of the air
that's the key after you drop shot
expect
a reply up over the net
something you control with a volley plus
you're forcing your opponent to make two
high exertion runs
i don't think i've ever seen him do that
i don't think i have either i've never
seen him catch an edge he just he just
trips up right here see that when he
goes to pivot and he can't regain his
look but he stays with it
and it's too late and then he pops right
up it's been a long time since he's been
able to bury a couple of balls in the
right corner
but it turns out to be
sort of a visual turning point perhaps
for djokovic love 30.
[Applause]
almost like a prize fight
i love the guys goes
down and it's an image that will be used
by television channels
forever yeah i mean this right here
that is so deep that's right on the line
triple break point
please
[Music]
talk about a big shot
in a big moment
steps around that's his 1-2 combination
big serve big forehand forehand goes to
the opposite court
[Music]
it's champion stuff
[Music]
he applauded the shot
his biggest service
[Applause]
his biggest has been 124. this was 121
but it's long
and he's down to one challenge for the
rest of this set unless it goes into a
tie breaker
where they give you one more
[Music]
long rallies great tension 21 shots
30 40
nadal has one talent remaining
we've already had one rally that went 54
shots
still break point for a chance to serve
for the second set
[Applause]
[Music]
you say it all the time now look at the
juice he's bringing look at the energy
the positive emotion
big players all-time greats on the core
right now coming up with everything
they've got when they absolutely need it
break point in the third set and you
deliver your first ace of the match
that's pretty good
and your fastest serve at 125.
in his box
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
hmm
[Applause]
squeezes out of this jam
and then ends up winning this djokovic
is going to kick himself
for just letting the dow get off the
hook
talk about a huge turning point if
mcdowell can cash in right here to take
a 5-4 lead he was down to break earlier
in this set
down triple break point in this game
[Applause]
from
[Music]
[Applause]
see the wind blowing
and that
is a huge factor
in that point right there no one really
got a solid solid hit on the ball
and that plays a huge part in this
process right now the tension
both players trying to grab the momentum
and then the wind played havoc just like
it was
yesterday in the women's final
[Music]
um
my
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
ah
[Applause]
that's a houdini job right there
rafael nadal survives
triple break point
these two are keeping everybody on the
edge of their seats and as nadal grabbed
the early lead they cheered for novak
djokovic to make it a match
and it lifted him at least it looked
like it did
and it's one set a piece and we're
getting down to
crucial time in the third
ah
[Applause]
that's why he has so many errors right
because he's going for shots like this
he really is i mean i i truly believe
that this is a
a strategy he's come into this match
with he understands he's going to be
taking a little bit more risk but he's
got to put the dowel on the defensive
because nadal is
so explosive on the hardcores
remember nadal is coming in here with
the 23-match win streak correct
and so he's coming in here with a lot of
mojo he beat
djokovic in montreal just three weeks
ago on a surface exactly like this with
the same ball
u.s open series event
[Applause]
it's one of the best
both players pouring out
every ounce every element they've got
lobs volleys defensive high backhand
ball either from djokovic
a certain shot from djokovic drop shot
from the dow
volley volley winner
every shot you want everything you want
and then adult caps it off with a
massive vamos
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
this is a huge point here
[Applause]
it should be very interesting to see
where djokovic goes this first serve
ideally you want to slide it out with
your right-handed serve out to the
backhand of the lefty nadal to pull him
off the court to set up a winning shot
to the other side
quality serve at 123 miles an hour
mcdowell gets the bracket on the ball
and now the pressure
really on djokovic
and it's set
ah
[Applause]
it's nadal's girlfriend even she can't
believe his good fortune
down triple break point which would have
allowed djokovic to serve for the set he
comes back from that then break serve
and now he's up two sets to one in new
york
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
the singles finals has not disappointed
the fans from around the world the
women's final went the distance three
sets
now djokovic nadal
in a fourth
[Applause]
with the first shot in the fourth with a
forehand winner down the line
his 39th winner of the match
[Applause]
[Music]
that was one of the great wiggle jobs of
all time unbelievable
[Music]
ah
meanwhile we are sitting in the booth
here looking at the list of celebrities
that are in attendance tonight we've
shown you some uh
[Applause]
azarenka serena williams match was they
took a shot bill clinton applauding
azarenka and she looked up and saw it
with a big boy pretty cool
[Applause]
now we've got an early fourth set
possibility here 15 30.
mcdonald's successful with a drop shot
out of nowhere
we've seen a really
nice drop shot from time to time from
both players
the doll here again a disguise it looks
like he's going to drive the backhand he
cuts it and then djokovic there in a lot
of time
doesn't handle his delicate drop shot
that 54
shot rally is all over the internet
already
ah
[Music]
uh
[Applause]
that's for a break point
instead of trying to reply with the drop
shot down the line
djokovic gets the really short angle
the drop for him
look at that and he slides right into
that
shot the queen of spain
can't believe it
[Applause]
[Music]
ah
and it's at this point i just start to
wonder if the
four-hour nine-minute semi-final even
though it was played on saturday with
the day off on sunday
does it start to creep into his
endurance
into his legs into his reaction time
he trains for this both athletes train
for these marathon matches
[Applause]
gluten-free diet how much he has really
dedicated himself
to being a better athlete a complete
athlete
from the physical mental and nutritional
side he's totally changed the menu in
the players lounge
okay last set for all these huge moments
rafael nadal seemed to have a special
shot
break point
george is challenging the call on the
right near sideline the ball is
i mean this is the first game of the set
and djokovic is willing to take a chance
with one of his three challenges here
[Applause]
both players
using challenges early in the sets
burning them
ah
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
here's the backhand approach
split step and then see that low
forehand volley there's so much velocity
and top spin on that passing shot it's
very hard to handle
especially around the net
and once again
they're up in nadal's box
she's got a much different expression
this time
[Applause]
look at him
[Music]
[Music]
he's missed two routine shots nothing
good about that
[Applause]
now it's really up to djokovic to do
what nadal did in the third
you're down in the game
you've got to produce you've got to come
up with some big moments some big swings
these are the difference makers
the doll takes the opportunity at
really love
himself the green light to unleash the
beast with his forehand
he crushed
three or four forehands before getting a
short ball to follow one in
to the net
and force the passing shot air here's
your triple break point
opportunity for nadal
[Applause]
everybody's bundled up for the long
emotional haul
coming up on three hours of tennis here
tonight in new york
[Music]
gets the bounce
[Applause]
he's doing his best
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
scenario you have to guess
left to right
joe has been so explosive to that side
of the court with his forehand so nadal
makes a calculated risk goes out to that
side and guess what there's the ball and
he rips a forehand down the line for a
winner
and a huge break of serve
now you're going to see djokovic come
back with everything he's got
he cannot afford he's down two sets to
one he's down 2-0
he is running out of games
you notice how collected he was djokovic
he can't afford a mental slip
he knows he is falling off the edge
back right again i mean that's just what
champions do they don't lose it
emotionally
he's concentrating on this game
[Music]
ah
[Music]
it's a nice syrup only 83 miles an hour
but it had so much junk on it
that's some top spin look at this thing
jumps right into novak's body almost
into his face
and he can't handle it
the old squibbers
30-15
so many moves and counter moves
throughout this entire championship
match so much familiarity
as we hit three hours we remember
in ten
nadal one at 11 djokovic won both
matches were four setters both matches
included a tiebreaker
[Applause]
in the fourth
uh
[Applause]
and that's exactly what we've got
up two sets to one
three games to love in the fourth
when this match started nadal was sharp
novak djokovic was fighting it
another great point between these two
then in the second set
he found a way to get to rafael nadal
serve
in the fourth set
he had triple break point to serve for
the set and nadal wiggled out of it and
won the next game
essentially the match is riding on this
server
well djokovic your mindset is real
simple you're just down to break it
looks a lot worse than it really is you
hold here you make a run at breaking
back and if you do you're just on serve
so if you're running out of games but
the reality is just keep your cool
incorporate your forehand once again
and if he does that the backhand will be
the complimentary piece in this whole
thing but he's it's the forehand that's
kind of let him down
in big moments
[Applause]
and there's a great example that
transition ball your ability to finish
off points
there's the great rod laver won the
traditional grand slam which is all four
in the same calendar year in 62.
he turned prone couldn't play again
until 68
and then won it again in 69.
so good goes right along if you're
djokovic okay here we go you put
everything into this break
all you've learned from all these
match-ups and everything you've learned
up to this point in this match where's
this guy going with his serve and where
is he going with his ground strokes
[Applause]
you're looking for patterns tendencies
strengths weaknesses
everything is in the how how am i
winning points how am i losing points
this is where the mindset has to come in
for the break
see that return was going straight up
the line
for nadal the worst thing you can do is
start thinking about the finish line
thinking about the overall score you've
got to concentrate on the now the time
is now
you have two sets to one you have a
break
in the fourth set
concentrate on your weapons and
deploying them
[Music]
ah
[Applause]
shots every other rally is just one
remarkable shot
after another
and here djokovic gets a lot of short
balls
and this one he comes in he's too far
off the court he was hitting that from
that single sideline and that's too much
of a window for nadal to hit that pass
15 all
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
ah
30-15
[Applause]
braving the elements braving the
pressure the worst seat in the house
is being in one of these guys's camps in
their box
you want the best
for your guy
and there's nothing you can do about it
for three hours plus
not to mention the entire tournament
[Applause]
second surface
the depth from the doll
it's a huge difference in his game when
he can place that
[Music]
and the ball gets short see how deep
that is now when that happens joe fish
has got to give up real estate and back
up and handle that heavy top spin ball
uh
[Music]
rafael nadal
big lead in the fourth set up two sets
to open court the billie jean king
national tennis center
in new york city
nadal is in pretty good shape in the
fourth set
novak djokovic has to hold sir
[Applause]
that's how he incorporates the forehand
inside out starts with the serve to open
up that side of the court then he
follows it in and finishes it with a
volley
but notice djokovic's concentration not
a lot of talk all business he knows this
is the game
there's no other game in his grand slam
year right now because this is it
the final slam of the calendar season
[Music]
and he's got to be perfect here
one of the dangerous he kind of second
guessed himself the cross court backhand
was wide open he knows it
but he gets away with it see how he
comes up here now he respects nadal's
speed so much that he thinks i'll just
go back door short
nadal doesn't bite on it
oh
[Applause]
that's his 50th unforced
error uh
[Applause]
i mean this this is
so big time
and this match can be over in a flash
i'm talking about at any time
if he slips in the next few moments
there's a 5-1 lead with mcdowell and
he's just gonna moonwalk this thing home
[Applause]
[Music]
everybody here knows what's at stake
[Applause]
uh
[Applause]
then
djokovic that's as easy of a passing
shot as you can get the dog guesses for
the down the line backhand right here he
just doesn't do anything with that
backhand volley he's kind of a bluff
and he gets away with it
[Applause]
i mean they brought the queen here from
spain to watch this i mean you can't
lose now
with the queen in the crowd thank you
ladies and gentlemen
