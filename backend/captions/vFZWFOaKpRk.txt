off to serve
ready
play 15
out 15 on
[Applause]
see adjustment that c wasn't against
bind Ben she said she was playing a
little bit too passive in that first set
and what she needed to do is be more
aggressive a perfect example there of
hugging that Baseline
terrific second serve may be an area
golf looks to go for just a little bit
more that second serve a bit
stiffer struggled behind her second
serve few times this past week she's
been able to work it out but doesn't
want to be on the back foot too
often comfortable hold for K on the
board one
more well it's first G for both players
it's jumping off their racket so much so
whoever gets the first strike in is
going to be in a great position and you
wonder if Koko is going to continue what
we saw in that match up against benich
trying to be a little bit more
aggressive on her second serve return
position the serve definitely not an
issue today though striking it
incredibly
well yeah she was really pressed against
Ben who stands closer to the Baseline
and takes the ball early can
redirect she may have or feel like she
has a little more time against Bosa
where she can stay in rallies a little
bit
longer but when golf is aggressive that
adds another element especially getting
inside up to the
net 15 PSA does have the ability to
match the service games in terms of
ability to hold getting free
points she has a big enough serve she
can occasionally get that UNR
returnable two big first serve thereza
to get couple of free points early on
it's so interesting to watch Po's bols
from the side of the Court though
because it really does get super far in
front compared to most of the players
and you just see more variety on the go
every time she steps up to the line it
seems to be slightly different one's a
little higher and then the the one
further in front but she just commits to
it
regardless b game there for bza holds to
love one game more sometimes it it seems
like you can read bza serve a little bit
more because she'll vary her toss and
especially if she's trying to go out
wide she kind of cheat with the toss a
little further
over but she hits it big enough and she
hits her targets well enough that
sometimes it doesn't matter
15 both these players are in the top 10
in terms of service games one coming
into this match they're both at above
80% able to back their serves and make
it tough for opponents to break
15
so couple for that forand side for Coco
G that be one particular side you'd say
bza attacking a bit more today that's
the strategy against golf for most
players it's not necessarily going to
create the Mist to go to the forehand
but she can't hurt opponents as much as
she can off the backhand side
rips back from the can crosscourt
pza
15 the key for golf on that forehand
side is to lean into it and keep the
racket head speed up through the contact
point but Bosa able to get something a
bit more hitable there leaned into it
save for
GF now she gets her fair share of UNR
returned serves Goff we talk about the
double faults but she matches it in Aces
just about and then you have those
serves that don't come back are just as
good as an ace
[Applause]
and the other intangible for golf is
just her will the ability to dig in in
the tough moments and matches and and
that's part of what gets her out of
these kinds of situations
yeah I'm totally with you CH the biggest
difference for me with Coco serve this
season is that she trusts it in the key
points pressure moments when you know
it's juice or she's down break point
that's when you see her biggest serve
and compared to six months ago it it's
just been a massive change in her game
but also in her mentality out here
there the double F he touched on Chand
up every now and then her serve can get
just a little too far out in front and
that is why the majority of those misses
will go into the net just kind of
collapses on the the
serve she had the idea for do up looking
just to capitalize a little bit when
that does land
short I think another reason that pedosa
is comfortable a little more comfortable
against golf is she can go toe-to-toe in
the backand side has a terrific
backand just missing that one slightly
fantastic return from
bza standing well inside the court off
that second serve return
[Applause]
and that's the forehand off got going in
her last
match see gf's Team there added Matt Dy
to her team latter part of last year he
was on the far left
[Music]
[Applause]
so she fights off two break points Coco
go from server in this first set
2-1 two games to one for
[Music]
six so from 1540 COC
go creates uses her big serve three big
serves in a
row now you figure she settled in nicely
we go through that first little bit of
adversity defending break points come
through
it still on serve now maybe gof can
swing away a little more freely and the
last couple of forehand those were the
type of free wheeling forehand that
started coming a bit more often for golf
it's part of the mindset shift that
she's had where she is attacking that
shot more and so she's able to do a bit
more
[Music]
damage
time so we're on serve here in this
women's singles quarterfinal match
between Coco go and POA
bza bza held her serve to love in her
previous service game served
exeptionally
well looking to do the same right here
bosa's toss that last one we kind of
tell she was going out to the forehand
because it was a little further out in
front and to her right to goff's left
and so Goff able to read it and get out
on the front
foot let's
love now it's a pretty big swing for
Bosa going from having had a double
break point in the last game to now
being down the start of her service game
go with a love 30 opening
bit of a missed opportunity there second
serve at love 30 for Coco
[Applause]
G looking to keep that ball deep but
just missing long
there
two those two last points for made for
Coco go standing again too far back
behind the Baseline first off that
second through return and then in that
rally
where just got a little bit stuck with
the
feet the GOL stayed home guessed
correctly but still couldn't control the
pace from Bosa
it started with a terrific wide serve
she's made that shot look too easy when
it's anything but boun smash from just
inside the Baseline plus you've got so
much sun above your head right now
it's tough conditions
hey
the right idea from go she tried to
guide that last
forand DOA doing a good job of picking
on that side just making G have to
prove that she
can keep that ball coming back one of
the more extended rallies as it is
heating up
oh gets
it she's so good when she's on the Move
isn't she golf it's almost better for
golf at times when she knows that it's
going to keep coming to her forehand
she's able on that on that shot to just
get a little more flick of the wrist a
little more speed through the contact
that little extra flick to get the spin
her team has to like
that Advantage
B so another long service game this one
almost hitting six minutes
gy hold there for paa bza still unserved
two both players having to fight for
their last service games and just
showing you why it's been some tight
matchups between them in the past why
that head-to-head is locked
even well in the previous two meetings
Bosa has won the first set
and those first sets were extremely
close in
r p won the first 75 and then in Beijing
Bosa won the first set
64 both match is lasting almost 2 and a
half hours as
well
15 against a lot of players that first
set would be a much bigger Advantage but
because G competes so well because she
can have another layer to go to in terms
of her speed and athleticism she can put
on the running shoes and just decide not
to miss and that's coming to play a few
times and this
matchup we heard golf talk about just
being more aggressive in that last match
you against benic and it's not a lot of
players that can play a couple of
different ways that could decide to just
make balls
and hang in rallies or can step in and
be more aggressive get into the net but
golf can do
both set up again nle with that big
first serve for golf I love to see her
run around that and play an inside out
forehand now you don't see that too
often often through the middle of the
court for Coco she actually prefers to
play an inside out backand so just to
have a a little more confidence today in
that shot from what we've seen earlier
on in this
tournament yeah I think that inside out
the willingness to hit the Inside Out
forehand
or take four hands from that side of the
court for golf is important although her
backand she can do so much with it it's
just not the same as the forehand when
you can disguise it when you can go
inside out or inside in it's a more
aggressive minded
shot good hold for gof on serve
32 gam two
for so saying a couple of long service
games and N another player really giving
away too much it's been a real battle so
far in this women singles quarterfinal
match two of the toughest competitors
you could get out on court as
well they both have tremendous back
hands that's the favorite side for for
each of these players they can each win
their fair share of UNR returned points
on
serve and there's a lot of
similarities in terms of of how they
look to play although golf has that
advantage in terms of the mobility and
her willingness to track those extra
balls down and that may come into play a
little more often if we continue to see
things nip and Tucks as we have so far
allurance so A beautiful day here at
Melbourne park for this women's singles
quarterfinal match between Coco go and
pela bza and it's been a high level of
tennis we're on
serve and
bza to serve now at 23
[Applause]
15 that having spent a lot of time
working on her mental
side has been working with a
psychologist just to add that one extra
tool
certainly came into play against Mar
kostuk the other day where the
conditions were so
tough I think we see both players trying
to adjust their Tendencies a little bit
but adosa trying to get her first top 10
win at a grand
slam fourth time of ass
asking theyve both made some adjustments
in terms of trying to go to each other's
forehand so we're seeing you know a
little more focus on changing direction
down the line backand
for each of them that's going to perhaps
be a valuable shot over the course of
this match
she's just standing up a little too high
Golf and some of bosa's shots she's
getting good shape on it so it's
bouncing up a little bit more on on golf
you know more than it would have done
against benage who hits the ball so flat
so she's having to make this adjustment
right now on the forehand side
14 yeah I totally agree PA's forehand is
just jumping up that much more and so
Coco's caught in this position of of not
knowing quite whether to go back half a
step Let It Drop further or try and cut
the angle off and take it on the rise
good aggressive play there from
Bosa three first set three game so for
ass
I feel because of how Lively the court
is playing today on the second Ser
return you can afford to actually stay
back if if that's what your plan is but
then you need to get the shape over to
bosa's forehand side get it above her
shoulder
slightly
15 that is a terrific serve on these
courts
especially get a little more side spin
where the ball stays a bit lower and
through the court combined with the
angle last two says going to the forand
of pza so clearly a tactic that g is
looking to use
4 you look at the strategy both are
trying to employ and it's like a mirror
image of of the other they they do it in
slightly different ways the ways they
produce their shots but they're trying
essentially to play a similar
style let's
[Applause]
comfortable hold for go she's in the
lead here 4
three golf leads four games to three for
six we found K gol I'm just mentally
banking that game Bel John in this set
just to know actually I can slow down
the first so Pace a little if I'm going
for the slice to the full hand it
doesn't have to be the biggest serve of
the match as long as it's consistent and
it's moving off the court that's a very
good chance you're going to come out on
[Music]
top so much of this match will be about
playing the right shots from the right
position and just trying to
maximize what either player can do
behind those early rally balls you know
we're seeing a couple more extended
rallies but I don't so far we're not
seeing very many still so much about
First Strike tennis and
rallies between one and four
shots so we're on serve here in this
women's singles quarterfinal match 30
minutes of
play okay gol leading four games to
three both players looking to attack off
the forand sides
[Applause]
exact same serve Coco go used in her
last service game on that juice side
slice out wide got the error Bosa doing
the same
that time golf stepping in and taking
that return just a little earlier it's
not naturally what she looks to do as
often but why not add this element to
her game
GF just took a little step over to the
right but still hasn't quite gotten the
timing on that crosscourt as as
consistently yeah we saw the lean but it
still seems like she's a little in no
man's land at the moment I think if
you're going to stay back then you got
to stay all the way back or commit fully
like we saw in the previous
point and it's exactly the point you
know that you make laa on that forehand
especially you've got to commit to it
you've got to commit to swinging through
the the contact Point leaning into it
and a few times it's been a little
hesitation body weight just going
sideways or going backwards
well she committed to a forehand return
G but the longer that rally went the
further back behind the Baseline she
got a couple of slice forehand from G
and just seems the forehand Landing A
Little Too Short yeah and Bosa able to
lean into hers a little bit more and
keep some consistent depth and that was
a big point for her to win
fighting on
Bosa We're Going the Distance in this
first
set four game
first opala can be a little guilty of
the the same kind of thing we've been
talking about the fact that the tactics
are almost mirrored but the the play
from the Baseline as well po can
sometimes drop too far back behind the
Baseline especially on that forand side
and when you look at how big she can hit
the ball you wonder why she doesn't
force herself to stay up the court a bit
more smart serving from golf and again
using a shorter serve that's going a bit
wider but do is not one who's going to
step in and take Returns on the rise so
there's some space for GF to work
[Applause]
with so a bed dep created there G and
getting the eror from Bosa so might not
think it makes a big difference but that
two extra feet three extra feet makes a
huge difference with the added Pace from
gof it's just another way to steal time
from the opponent on the other
side 14
impressive stat there for both players
winning such a high percentage of points
when that first serve does go in
4
15 some good serving there from Coco go
holds a n and leads
54 gol leads five games to four first
six we've been talking about how similar
the strategies are between these two
players the tactics they're both looking
to play the others
forand more often and when you look at
rally placement for both players over
the course of this first set for Bosa
39% of the time she's going to the golf
forand middle of the Court she's also
testing that part as well 38% of the
time and for golf it's pretty similar I
mean you hardly ever see numbers this
close but golf 40% into bosa's forehand
and down the middle trying to cut off
give Bosa no angle 36% of the time and
then the thrown in backhand just to keep
the other honest so seeing numbers this
close figure something's got to give who
can add that additional element but so
far it's been a battle of who can hold
up on the forehand
side well it's a hot day here at
Melbourne Park 29° certainly feels a lot
hotter on
court in this women's quarterfinal match
no breaks have served thus
far as we
get as we near towards the end of this
first set P DOA serving to try and level
things here
15 l
smart from P DOA those last two serves
going to the backand of
GF they've got to mix it up just enough
to keep the other honest and create some
open space to the
forehand 14
[Applause]
4K that's an opportunity for gol when
she does see a second serve where she
has a little more time to lean on
it okay
so some press apply for boso and we're
tired here in this first set five all 41
minutes of
play this was a terrific play from Bosa
a more difficult forehand than it
appeared and she got nice Spin and
control on it and then move
forward maybe isn't the place where BOS
is the most comfortable up at the net
but that was a terrific move
out
big point there from P
DOA so crucial to win those first two
points of the game what a great job she
did there and she's got to be bold P do
especially in some of the extended
rallies who can pull the trigger first
and execute she's able to do both
both
love standing quite far behind that
Baseline of that last forehand goof and
with that error she's love 30 now
help
15 1
[Applause]
two couple of missed for hands from
Bosa as the pressure ramps up just a bit
more she's at the only break points of
the match so far Bosa couple that she
had in gol second service
game no break points for either since
then
oh unbelievable from
Bosa what an effort especially off that
last backend
volley the pickup beforehand though had
to play it as almost a half volley a Top
Spin half
oy and she's been looking to use that
forehand to be
aggressive gets that shorter response
and just to get that little Dr shot
there
beautiful and she gets the break bza for
the first time in this
set she'll come out to serve for it
65 B leads six games to five for six
PSA able to just get the upper hand on
Goff with the forehand side and we've
talked about how it's been a forehand
battle you know who can hold up on that
side who can create a few more
opportunities and Bosa playing
disciplined tennis using the backand to
open up the
court and she hasn't been afraid though
to go for the forehand and that's been
so far the slight difference between
these two players yeah it's just a
little more weight of shot from down
court side especially in those last few
rallies and you think back to early on
in the point she had the love 30 then
miss two forehand but she missed them in
a really positive way she was going for
the
shot then just relied on it when it
[Music]
mattered so it's been a battle in this
women's singles quarterfinal
match bza getting the break of serve at
five
all and it will now be coming out to
serve for this first set
[Applause]
and Coco out change going over to her
coaching box asking for some clear
advice JC farell in the middle there
long time part of her coaching
team now alongside Matt d
[Music]
15 not easy s for a set so thought pal
but do up the mindset has to be to stay
aggressive just like in that previous
game where she broke the serve
she's got the aggressive positioning and
you can tell she's trying to go after
the forehand but just still not timing
it the same way and that's the
frustration for G right now H how does
she continue to commit to going after
the forehand with some of these misses I
think she should
there she absolutely should you're not
going to find the timing and the Rhythm
by going further back and then playing
it off the outside leg as a defensive
shot it comes back from having that
momentum coming through the swing making
sure you're in the right position
yeah now the backand Miss
and clear frustration from
G so set point opportunity now for pal
bza
she get the first
do ble she ends up on Top seven games to
five
and there it is go moving forward we
talked about kosa stepping up at the end
of that first set in the last two games
of the set overall today 118 kilm per
hour on the forehand the last couple of
games of the set 8 km per hour quicker
off that side
out of interest do you have Coco's
average four hand speed up there we
don't have it up here
no we can get it though I'm sure now
that I've said it someone's working in
it
and it's funny you ask Laura because off
her average forand speeds are exactly
the same as B Do's were until the last
last two games of the set 118 km per
hour so they were even in terms of those
numbers and then Bosa just up the anti
go now meeting power for
power I know she missed the last two
forehand SCF but I felt like she was in
a better position she was using her left
leg more to step inside the shot and hit
through the court
team happy with that one
sometimes when you're so focused on one
side the other side can suffer and that
Miss backand from golf not quite as free
flowing as her usual yeah and she's
telling her box she should have hit that
one
crosscourt so breakpoint opportunity now
for pza to get ahead in this second
set looking nowh that back
hand it's interesting start both players
winning every point every time they do
get to that net as well and if Bosa
could have heard G's last comment to her
team maybe she would have moved to the
crosscourt on that back
end figure it was going
there advantage
on
juice
[Music]
Advantage go
she's certainly looking at keep being
aggressive and I think that's the right
play for
bza yeah she's able to lean on the
backhand obviously that is a shot she
doesn't hesitate on but she's been doing
similarly on the forehand and that's
part of the challenge here for golf
right now
Advantage maybe she can get it going
with the serve a little more
often it's been Bosa a few more UNR
returned
serves that number has dropped for golf
a lot of her serves are now coming back
and that's adding to the pressure that
one beautifully placed
juice so another long service game for
Coco go a third a double fault for the
match as
well you'd have to think how huge is
this first game for both players
ability for Bosa to just grab more of
the momentum if she can get an early
break go trying to reset
here and after losing the first set
she's come out a little more aggressiv
minded up at the net and maybe that
helps
her and just to lean on that slice serve
on the juice side
again she's just not going to get as
much pressure on that plus one shot when
she goes to that
serve oh dear another double fault with
an when has had that opportunity to get
ahead in his second
set it's really the timing of the double
foughts this is just the second one
fourth double fought of the match but
two now in this game and that is one of
the worst times for it not the worst but
close
and that is
tentative just doesn't seem to be enough
body weight going forward she's just
waiting for the ball isn't she go and
then the further back she gets the
shorter that for hand gets and Bosa just
capitalizes on
it so a second breakpoint opportunity
for Bosa
it's better start to that
point but you look at the options that g
has when the ball is coming to her
forehand she can either change the
direction going down the line which we
saw her trying to do but she wasn't
comfortable doing it so that shot was
tinted if she missed it or she can take
on the challenge and keep going
crosscourt with that shot that's been
the struggle so far today
just I was just about to say maybe you
can see a court side law but the the
first two forand there from goo go it
looked like she was ripping through it
she was in a better position and then
just out of nowhere that forehand just
lands in the middle of the net yeah I
actually think on the previous forand
the one that she went line it wasn't a
clean ball strike anyway you almost see
that she's trying too hard to do
something with it at this point and
almost trying to muscle through the shot
[Music]
[Applause]
and it's so hard when you're under
pressure to keep the arm relaxed to keep
the footwork up and and the footwork for
me is there it's just with the upper
body it's looking almost stiff as she's
following through with the motion
[Applause]
Advantage getting a look on a number of
second serves in this service game from
golf you almost feel like Bosa has got
to break here if she does not it becomes
an disadvantage that she had all these
opportunities and good
looks good pressure there from go
advantage bosi
[Applause]
take unforced here off that forehand
side for goth in this match thus
far great Point number five for
Bosa game it's fifth time lucky for
Bosa so she breaks early on in this
second
set she's a set and one love first
second and she has just lost all
confidence on that forehand side and and
even the occasional nice hit she's
getting GF still not
enough to hold up against Bosa
continuing to test that side and smart
in the end from Bosa to just go up the
middle take some of the risk out of it
and force gol to have to come up with
something more whether it be an
angle or a deep shot and gol not able to
do it so we have really flip-flopped
terms of the win predictor as you would
expect with Bosa winning that first set
31% swing in the favor of
Bosa now Bosa with a break in hand but
this match far from
over how does gol respond now
now thank you players
ready 15
left well the way that adosa won the
last point of the previous game just by
by playing almost a little bit more
defensive more height and shaped to
Coco's forehand that's just given her a
bit of breathing room I think to know
that actually she can go to the plan B
if the nerves do start to kick
in 15
this is almost a time of the match where
Bosa should not be missing balls make
golf especially if you're going to the
forehand make golf have to hit a shot
off that
side no just like
that and she's made some good
adjustments with DOs I mean there's been
some nervy shots from her as well but
she's been able to get back to exactly
what has worked what the strategy is and
the strategy has worked perfectly for
the Spaniard
third that b dos Just Landing too far
out in front for
bza couple of free
points of her racket in this game
that's a well done Point things are
getting a little tight a little tricky
and Bosa holding her
nerve that forehand down the line that
is not an easy shot at this time in the
match and especially off that side and
Bosa handled it
beautifully she's really backing herself
isn't she
that great
effort game bules and consolidates the
break for
DOA goty effort from the Spaniard
Bosa leads two games to love second s
I've often looked at this matchup
between G and Bosa and thought from golf
standpoint that she could play a less
one-dimensional match and this match
overall has been pretty one-dimensional
we've seen
occasional player come in one or two
changes of Spin and
pace and I think for the most part it's
just been from the ground and it's been
very much east and west and N GF has
another layer another level she can
bring she has additional skill sets and
this would be the time for her to test
it test those skill sets against
Bosa crushing that return P
[Applause]
DOA I mean at this point G has more foot
speed more athleticism than Paulo the
Paulo BOS is a terrific athlete golf has
another
level she could actually just get down
and and refuse to miss even if she has
to get more Spin and hit more up the
middle
trying to fire herself up
go third
15 using the legs getting out to that
one and not panicking on the pass
4
[Applause]
15 an opportunity now for G to get on
the board in this second set
take
[Applause]
that g trying to go out wide again but
doer reading it slapping that one down
the
line she's on the board go good DOA
still with a break 2-1 second set two
games to one second set and by one
[Applause]
set and that hold got golf's team on
their feet because it was an important
game for golf to just dig in to this
second set keeps it to just the one
break of serve and with some of the
tense games we've
seen golf has yet to have break
opportunities but she's been close and
holding there was pivotal for
her and you'd have to think for pza
she'd be very well aware of how their
previous meetings have gone and knowing
that g will continue to fight for every
point so mentally it's as much as a
battle as it is physically it is and
Bosa would know that this match is not
over even a set and a break you know
golf has come back from those kinds of
deficits even winning the US Open she
was able to do it on the biggest stages
so you do not take that part for granted
and bosa's got to stay plugged in
here women singles quarterfinals here on
Rod La
Arena and it's 11th seed paa bza finding
her way through took the first set seven
games to five and she's up a break in
this second set
[Music]
15
left I think on some of those forehand
if G had it in mind that she was going
to hit it and come in it wouldn't be
such an All or Nothing shot that she has
to hit to a certain
spot it's not easy to come in
nowadays players able to get the ball
dipping to get it down but I think it
would add to something that Bosa has to
think about and that's right now what
would be used for Coco
go yeah just like
that ended up being a winner but the
ball was inside the court and golf was
looking to move
forward and capitalizing also on that
short of response from
bza so maybe a slight opening now for go
[Applause]
154 and she just has to keep this close
enough to let the nerves creep in
because this would be a huge huge moment
and win for pao Bosa
and the closer you get to the Finish
Line the harder it gets and we're a long
way from that just
yet
game so go gets the
break wins two straight games and we're
two all in this second set second set
poosa looking for her first top 10 win
at a major this would
be a huge moment for her
in that service game for the most part
she broke herself a couple of good shots
from golf
but all of a sudden now big shift in the
momentum and I'm sure Coco can feel this
because all of a sudden she can sense
that her opponent's not taking the ball
as early as as she was and not ripping
the forehand quite as much and you just
need an inch to work with
L
15 so new balls
here trying to find some control now off
that forehand golf
15
so much good happens behind the first
serve of golf especially when she's
placing it well
[Applause]
two allowing herself to step inside that
cord and
[Applause]
attack there an opportunity to take a
lead now in this second set
4
1 count
those are another one of those shots
that she could give herself golf a bit
more margin and just get in behind it I
mean that was short enough to just put
herself in better position not try to
make the the forehand more of the
finishing
shot it's terrific from
Bosa finding that little sliver of down
the line that she
needed
Advantage oh Coco go looking to get
inside that court and did s off that
last backand to get to the net but you
have to give credit to
pza on the stretch what it wasn't a
great approach though GF tried to do the
jump hop and she lost actually some pace
and solidness behind
it okay
so another breaker serve for
Bosa gets back out in front 32 second
set games to Second
and from 405 up Coco go she has been
broken yet again in this second
setosa able to step up and reassert her
Authority got a little bit of help from
from golf though who GF did some good
things in that game but just I think a
slight change in the mindset the the
purpose behind getting in and putting
yourself in that position is to make
your opponent come up with these tough
shots and if they do too good but DOA
able to do it on one of those points but
I think if gol can do a little more of
that it'll help steady her a bit cuz
right now missing from the ground you
just want to do something different you
don't want to lose the same way
three breaks of sered in this second set
thus
far paa
bza has been finding her way to just
stay on top in this match won the first
75 was up to love in this second set go
broke back and now bza looking to
consolidate the break
here 15
[Applause]
15 this is where Bosa has to be careful
lost her serve the last service game
just throwing in few additional misses
she has to give herself a bit more
margin
here that always helps doesn't big first
serve y get some free
points I mean the average rally length
of each point is about though four shots
[Applause]
450 the right kind of mistake from Coco
though to go big with the return down
onto the
feet get
BSA uncomfortable out
here
gamea good hold there from
Bosa very surprising how many forehand
we've seen GF Miss just in similar ways
and you know know that forehand side is
tricky for her
but just tough to understand the full
mindset I kind of understand going for
it but she's sort of in between
still and it's the sort of conditions
that aren't helping either when you feel
like it's flying off your Racket and you
don't quite know whether to go for more
pace and then you miss one because the
court is so Lively at the moment and
then you just start
overthinking DOA there for the trickiest
shot she could have hit instead of going
to the open court and that the tension
comes into play for for
everyone let first
15 13 that's 15 unforced erors off the
forehand side for Coco go in this second
set 27 overall
love that
play waiting for her been waiting for
her to make a few more of these kinds of
calculated moves doesn't mean you're
going to win every point but this add
some weight to golf's game without
adding to the risk
[Applause]
304
[Applause]
golf just not feeling that forehand
today and it's another break point for
Bosa okay b gets the break yet
again only a game away from a place in
the semi-final she's a set and
52
by well it must be quite demoralizing
for Coco go because not only is the
forehand side not working but she's
throwing in the unforced erors off the
backand and the serve yeah this was
always a tough matchup and we've seen it
in the matches they've had in the past
though gol has found a way last couple
of times they've played but the ball is
bouncing up a little bit here it's
getting up in an area golf is not as
comfortable with she's also not feeling
it and then you look at Bosa and she's
doing just enough in in some of these
situations certainly she's been able to
step in more on the forehand side and
that was the big question for both of
them who could take control who could
play more confident from that side of
the
so far it's been Paula
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
Bosa well what a moment now for paa
Bosa she is serving for a place in the
semi-final here at the Australian Open
oh that had a little bit of Venom behind
it l 15 now she's been Rock Solid golf
has above the shoulders on some
difficult
overheads and just coming out of the
chain jber the crowd was starting to get
really loud for coo they can sense that
she needs something to work with here
C that for turning defense to
offense poda was in full control at the
start of that
point but something that Coco does so
well you touched on it chander is just
turning that point
around lck 14
[Applause]
so not the way bza would have liked to
have played this service game so
far 154
[Applause]
G continues to
fight that was better on the forehand
that was a tricky shot but she didn't
panic she didn't overplay it she hit it
as an approach to get in position at the
net gof still in it saves one break
[Applause]
huge there from
Bosa had one the point Coco go got back
into play and then they had to restart
the point what a fight
there's been some critical moments in
this match where it could have shifted
dramatically for Paula Bosa in a
negative way and she has found a way to
dig in it's another one of those moments
15 the difference in body weight going
through the shot all of a sudden it's
just ridiculous to see from the side of
the
Court finishing the shot using the legs
through the body
oh she's finding that full hand
GF thir 15 GF has to she has to come up
with it and so she does and that is the
mark of a special kind of
player back against the wall and she's
coming up with some of her best forehand
of the match
14
15 and out of nowhere you sense a bit
more stress and frustration down bosa's
end
now she's got a sense I mean golf is
clearly playing better and then now it's
a whole shift in energy that she's
contending
with SM play there from are just sing
off a little bit far back behind that
[Applause]
Baseline time for one of the first Drop
shots that we've seen in this match Bosa
was in terrific position just in front
of the Baseline G never saw it
coming okay go
continues to fight Cod
go two straight
games five five games to four second
sets and by one set to
lo oh
wow this is where it gets interesting
now we going to test the nerve of of
palosa she served for it once and it was
a quick game G got off to a terrific
start and B DOA blink
this is the real test
now another chance to serve for this
match serving for her first top 10 win
at a major first semifinal at a major
semi-final in her career so much to be
played for
