and here we
go older wiser and probably if it's
possible a little
better than
the 2008 selves and if you've seen any
of the footage from that great match
you'll know that they look like boys
then they look like men now
15 well he lost the last point they
played here so that'll be a relief for
him
15
on
13 for me that's the serve we've got to
look out for in in the juice box you see
where Nadal's positioning is he's a long
way back that really does open up the
angles for federa to serve out wide even
Ser them
volley 14 15
go by Ms 43
[Applause]
[Applause]
rafan adal first number one after the
2008 final real Changing of the Guard
that
match back in 2008 Roger fedra first at
the top of the game as number one in
2004 103
Nadal in Grand Slams that's more
domination than you might imagine six of
them were at the French Open the only
time fedra has ever beaten Nadal at a
grand slam outside of wiland the
Australian
Open 2017
rapael Nadal to
I think that's another important fact
today is how well can fedra handle the
Nadal surf how quickly he gets into the
points especially on Nadal's second surf
cuz that's where he has to take
advantage if he wants to stand the
chance
LED for service it's a bit quiet in
here whole Center Courts a bit
hushed we a
[Applause]
no you
love 40 love
[Applause]
okay
up one game all
[Applause]
for just the first probings in this
match it's their fifth
ever match in a grand slam
semifinal Nadal won the four
so that's the tactic we're talking about
Nadal a long way back feder able to get
in tight if federa continues to do that
it'll be interesting to see whether
Nadal changes his return position
more
speed and the FED ground
strokes very familiar faces by now in
his box
4
L
Gad by two games to one
just the seven minutes played here both
these players have a losing record
against the man who Waits them in the
final there'll be no thoughts of what's
coming on Sunday no particular fatigue
for any of these players so far jovic
will probably want some Titanic five
Setter that will virtually disable these
two in terms of their effectiveness for
the final that's happened before it
happened when
Novak and Rafa
played beautiful match at this point
last year Anderson and Isner had played
each other to a stand still none of that
this year Boris they've been dominant
haven't they these three once again it's
been amazing yeah it's wonderful to see
these great Legends you know goats of
the game find a way to push each other
stay the course get better with every
year it seems
like uh the Next Generation whoever is
behind him doesn't seem to close the
gap time did you just call them goats
three of them what's that the greatest
of all time it's not an animal it's just
the highest title in any
sport couple of goats going head
to-head like that no breaks
it's one two quickly please ladies and
Gentlemen people just coming back in
after the first semi-final had an hour
off they didn't have that before team
right this is new this year or they've
had it last year already the gap between
first and semi-final yeah a little bit
more precise I think
now let for
service certainly in quer in the query
match with Nadal he was very anxious to
know the exact timings and
4:00 seemed like a good cut off for the
handshake of the previous match
[Applause]
15 it's also a little of buildup for
both players so mentally they need to be
stimulated it's a long wait it's a long
48 hours since they played last time so
it their engine can't be yet at 100%
[Applause]
slipped away but was able to manage and
keep his
balance beautiful short backand
slice stopped on the line didn't it as
well I think I might better see the mark
over there it's a shame the ball stops
when it hits the
light let for service
[Applause]
coach Francisco Roy has been talking
about rafh and adal and how he's been
playing with Precision with intensity
and fluidity but also how he
changes his stance on serve according to
the surface just tiny
alterations specifically for Grass Court
play that's
precise 14
give Nadal a short one on the
forehand and he says thank
you 403
games is that
Sebastian Roger Dad here as well
must be a gift to be able to take your
practice improvements right out onto the
court mentioned before Tim both these
players
improved without doubt you have
to
K it's the Ser of you mentioned the
short wide
one see how many free points he gets
before Nadal changes his position
love both players been very efficient
early on on their service games only
given up a couple of points
each both doing a good job of dominating
the points let's for service
40 love
I'd say that's the shot Nal improved the
most that quick backand now cross cord
[Applause]
by three games to
two fascinating quar of an hour just the
opening salbo in this second semifinal
at wimon Roger fedra certainly added to
his game over the years but so is rafan
adal Boris Becker has just mentioned how
his backand has increased in its potency
over the years but certainly his Ser has
as well Tim and Boris have a quick look
at this I mean it's got a few bit some
Bobs on it but it's the Nadal serve
alteration Francisco Roy coach talking
about this now last year is in the red
and those Trails really just
illustration so in the red on the right
in the top right so at the hit point it
was slower this is during the the whole
tournament pre- bounce slower post
bounce obviously slower and at the
returner significantly slower so he's
whatever he's done Tim he he's he's
quickened It Up by can't speak for the
accuracy but Nadal surf has certainly
looked more effective yeah definitely I
think when you you mentioned Francisco
Roy talking about how he positions his
feet I think uh you know now he's he's
actually hitting the serve a little bit
flatter on some of the other surfaces
you feel like he's coming round the side
of the ball to create that spin a little
bit more curve on the ball but this one
as you see by that flight on Hawkeye
much flatter going through the court a
little bit quicker and in percentage
terms by the time it's getting to the
returner it's probably 20 25% exactly
faster it is thank you thank you
something that we'll continue to watch
the Nadal serve now at
23 15
30 love
4 love yeah it's the first serve that
does the damage Roger doesn't really get
into the uh return games at
all game Nal
[Applause]
Three G all for one thing you can never
really measure but you can feel and the
whole tournament has and these Champions
that I'm sh in the comary books have
understood and perceived is confidence
and he's had it there's been a presence
around Nadal during this tournament he's
won 17 straight matches across the
Italian open in Rome and also in Paris
at the French Open where he just won his
12th French so Nadal in Supreme form
you talk about confidence I think
there's a confidence in Rafa's game but
there's also confidence in his body he
had some big challenges early on in the
year but feeling in very good
shape in fact on n's way winning his 12
he beat F the
semi-final in straight sets
a first victory for Nadal over feder in
some five and a half years
and that will amaze people hadn't beaten
him since Australian Open semi-final in
2014
[Applause]
F El games to three
first it's a clinical start from both
players feder has only dropped three
points in four service games Nadal only
two points in three service
games are they both going to be able to
maintain that as we move towards the
business end of this first
set statue of Fred Perry out there
always a good place to get the shot a
winner of so many major championships 10
Majors eight grand slams two pro slams
and a brilliant table tennis player as
well this is all part of the new
development now this camera whizzes
along at about 30 mil an hour and it's
on a great big zip W and it gives us new
shots at this wonderful Center
Court the development around this club
goes on and
on that's the members balcon there that
you can see and one or two people from
the raw box will pop out there take a
break go back in these courts on the
front they used to be so the focus of
the Championships but now it's just
developing into a much bigger space like
over the road for instance Church Road
into wimon Park Golf Club it's be the
next major phase of the development so
good luck with all that
Tim indoor courts between now and then
across on Somerset Road they're going to
be
demolished fairly soon after this
championships probably a 18 month to
2year project to knock those down build
six indoor six outdoor and a large
underground car
park they playing with new balls so
everything is a quicker
now feder had a shot after good
return didn't use
it there's a 25 second rule for the
server notal is always pushing the
envelop
15 something's about to happen I don't
quite know what it is in this match it's
all been it's been pretty cagy hasn't it
but uh you'd think if feder got a second
serve here at 15 all might like to try
and take a chance
[Applause]
15 a little bit up fortunate with the
net court but F has taken full advantage
oh didn't really do enough with the
return
fedra was it the serve yeah I think you
got to give credit to Nadal there decent
second serve really dictated with his
first forand to get the Federer on the
defensive
no
first great point of this
semifinal of the
eror looking to be very aggressive in
the rally there
and over hitting the back
and needs to find the first
serve e
we
go this is a Lev up isn't it the
footwork from r onad d the slicers from
fed this is the dance between these
two beautiful to
[Applause]
watch very keen to hit fore hands
that hasn't changed in 11
years Advantage
NAD reading the serve again well
returning well not taking advantage now
here we see Tony Dal flew in last
night supporting his famous
nephew that thing was
whipped three very strong points from
the DAR from break point G
for finding the targets with the first
serve and then really ating with the
forehand now he would like to try and
get stuck into a federal service game at
4all keeping fedra
waiting he got full compliment of ticks
and Twitches at this
point bristling for the action here
didn't find his timing on the returns
yet
[Applause]
good LEDs for service
1 fedra really mentioned his serve
picking up in the nishik Cory match
which was the quarterfinal and he really
start away left off on Wednesday evening
there look from Roger the Umpire
questioning the
call but no
challenge does have an awful record in
challenges throughout the champ
chip
[Applause]
4
game it's a challenge but both men are
in the
sunshine to the change
over
good still no breaks just the one break
point well saved by Rafa in his previous
service game he will serve to stay in
this first
set Roger fedra was talking before this
match Boris about just remembering to
stay calm and how it's okay just to get
the ball back back and to neutralize
opponents he does that takes the pace
off as well as puts it on as well as
anybody the trouble is if you just knock
it back to Nadal he can take control of
the rally so there's the the line that
he has to walk isn't it no very much so
I was really intrigued how calm he
stayed when he walked on the quar very
much in his son really didn't
acknowledge the crowd too much didn't
acknowledge his opponent either just
that didn't add a bit of a handshake and
he's all together has a very calm
demeanor because he knows actually the
things are heating up but he's here is
best when he lets his tennis do the
talking and when he doesn't get too
emotional you coached against him with
Novak jovic I believe you won six grand
slams with Novak when you were coaching
against Roger fedra it's quite a
challenge isn't it no that's right we we
had him in two womon finals and and the
key was always you know to get him on
the Run cuz when he's running he loses a
bit of his balance but that's easier set
than done and I was find a way to return
to rers Fed Ser as well
so thank you ladies and
gentlemen I think the same goes for
Rafael Nadar
15 love
Mr Nadal is challenging the call on the
left Far Side line the balls SC
[Applause]
out first double of the
match
only for the tournament this the sixth
match for both players of
course
1
no it's not the time to be reading put
it down got you this ticket
14 15
[Music]
[Applause]
umpire said it was very
close must have been
long half believes him Nadal should have
checked that it was
[Applause]
in is challenge to the four and the left
cice line safe to say they're both
hitting it close to the lines I think
this one just caught the line from the
[Applause]
d game
the there's a statistic about challenges
by rer fed at Wimbleton he's now
including this 3 to 16 is that right
yeah you have been burying your head in
books and readouts and research I'm
prepared
[Applause]
15
love you get this this far out of CT on
the forehand you got to make sure you do
some damage feder a little bit lucky
with the drrive volley Nadal not able to
do more with the
pass
4 and another 40 laugh easy hold by the
great
Swiss and that's his
[Applause]
[Music]
wife leads by six games to
five still no breaks in the sunshine
here on Cent cord at 65 to Roger f this
hugely anticipated
match now Roger fedra was talking about
neutralizing opponents and you often do
that with a slice or or a chip but the
actal statistics on on fedra here the
return spins that he's playing with
today previous rounds of course
different opponents different setup RAF
is not down the other end but in the
previous rounds top spinning at 59%
today he's trying to come over the
return the slice today 1 and 10 or or
just above 1 and 10 he's trying to come
over the ball and it's not working
particularly at the moment not not
working particularly well but I don't
think he's really had that many
opportunities obviously when you're
playing the slice it gives Nadal more
time to get round and hit his forehand
and really be aggressive so is he trying
to avoid the raer forehand by hitting
the return well because he'll hit it
harder with the Top Spin he can get it
through the court get to potentially
Nadal's backhand more
easily I think the way this set's
unfolding it would be fitting if it did
go to the tie
break well hitting over also means he's
more aggressive the mindset is I have to
hit over the ball and put some pressure
on your p
15
love that's love
40 love
145
403 if they are going to go to a breaker
feder would have rather made Nadal work
a little bit which is what he's doing
here even if the tiebreaks only
postponed for a point
another luped forehand and we could be
back at
juice and that's what it
is oh this has come out of nowhere this
is
now a battle
for and thought he love juice but the
fedra was able to hit over the return
three times good pressure on him right
away took advantage of the short ball
oh got the shot that he
wanted C the shot that he wanted butage
Nal when he was trying to hit that
forehand down the line to Nadal's
backand his body weight was just falling
away just keeps it calm cool
it's away and after 34s of an hour at
this semi-final it is a tie break we
decide
set six games over
first set TI now the last time they
played on this court they've played two
of the finest tie breaks of all time fed
won them both 75 and 108 Tim Henman has
done some extensive research oh 39
matches they played 21 tie breaks Nadal
up
1110 let's second
service he has not made that
that is some amazing cord
speed fedra followed this in the drop
volley beautiful zero Nadal oh dear
dear unbelievable control at the end of
the run there
and he sometimes sense that federa
thinks God does Nadal only make that
shot against me
I can see the shackles from both players
are slowly coming off they're freeing
themselves from all the tension all the
buildup letting loose
[Music]
the importance of this first set even in
a five Setter where there is more times
more time to recover illustrated by the
fact that the winner of the first set of
their matches has won
31 out of the 39
contests decent Front
Runners statistics don't lie two
all but this topic is very much nose to
nose
[Applause]
32 Nadal the defensive skills of Nadal
not only on the return of serve just to
float that one beat deep
and big forehand from feder and he's
able to use his left-handed forehand and
loop it
back asking federa to hit one more
shot let's for service
re
that's out on the Baseline looking for
the hand
from Baseline judge without it came and
this was a controlled volley from
fedra keeping it to what is still the
weaker side it was a good return again
from feder it was a decent serve from
the dial feder is able to come over the
top of the back
hand turn defense into attack and get up
forward to the net
for a second time federa is equalizing a
mini
break SP yet
[Applause]
[Applause]
and he comes over that back hand
return gets to the r of P
hand and then this
forehand 43 first time he's been ahead
in the
breaker theal likes very much the first
ser and then the forehand right away
feder is able to hit with his returns
onto the Nadal backand and sets him up
nicely that's a big point that forehand
had to be played
just low enough to make it difficult and
choosing to go to the spaniard's
[Applause]
forehand couple of time the first Serv
there from feder
63
[Applause]
fed arer still very
calm and exterior at
least very focused
51 minutes of fascinating tennis it's
one set to the older man on the tie
break from behind to Wi it's 73
[Applause]
and this is how he
concluded the first
set and that c on the return
Boris the feat so urgent he's four weeks
away from his 38th birthday he could be
playing in the uh the age group events
here look what it means perhaps even
more important for him to win the first
set than than RAF NAD bis I'd say so I
think if fed standing a chance he has to
win the first set the longer the match
tracks on the more he gets into a battle
I think the younger player
benefits and even winning the first set
I thought he kept his emotions in Jack
he wasn't over joyful he wasn't
celebrating too much from
far he knows he needs every ounce of
energy and
concentration we were to win the
semi-final your impression of the first
set
Tim very very tight only one break
point in the tie break it was Nadal who
had those mini break opportunities but
federa really upped his
game great accurate serving dominating
with the forehand when he got the
opportunity and he'll be delighted to
got that first set under his belt and I
think the early stages of this second
set are going to be absolutely vital for
both players it's Nadal that's going to
need
to regain the momentum stamp his
authority
early Federal will sense his
opportunity to take a commanding
lead feder playing a
21st Wimbledon Championship we didn't
ever imagine that it would last this
long when he hit that forehand winner
against Pete sess you might remember in
the last 16 in 2001 that had been the
culmination of a buildup everybody in
the sport had known about this fantastic
Talent up until that point but on a
wider and on a global scale this has
been feder's stage he has won this
Championship eight
times only Martina andova has won the
singles Championship more the man in the
dark glasses is Tony godik with the blue
hat there that's his dad
Robbie wife you think A lot's happened
since these two played on Center Court A
lot's happened for Mera she's become the
mother to four children who are not here
today they might be in the background
somewhere but two twin girls and two
twin boys and your great rivalry oh
great rival Stephan
edur up there you played one or two
matches against him here have you caught
up with him yeah we have yes I saw him a
couple days ago supporting Roger on his
fourth round match and uh his luck his
charm he stayed the weak S one of the
alltime grades where's Rafa oh there's s
David aten
BR he been been speaking a lot lately on
on climate change in the most
authoritative voice
and Sympathy for the environment and and
I think he'll probably approve of the
sustainability program that the all
England Club will put in this
year when rackets are delivered back to
the court you won't see them delivered
in plastic bags anymore and that's just
one of many many changes which have been
implemented now Roa is ready to return
Huffer took little break here we see
David Beckham big fan of tennis on the
Championships is his uh his children
play don't they his son Romeo is an arit
tennis player big Nal fan I wonder if he
spoke he must have spoken to Sir Alex
Ferguson as former manager me I hope
they
you'll remember the boot kicking
[Applause]
incident there he is good to see him
back hey with heal last
[Applause]
year Nadal gets the opportunity of
serving first in the second set
importantly he keeps his nose in front
Federal will be looking for an early
break
15 low it's quite a long break between
the end of the first set and the very
first
point I'm not a massive fan of you Boris
this too long it just interrupts the
Rhythm the flow of things I mean it's
all within the the rules
but but Nadal has done it every single
time I saw him here regardless whether
he wins it off loses it
we've talked about Nadal's improved back
and
fedra one of the reasons why he it's
when he can plant that right foot when
he can step into the court and drive the
back
end good signs for the federa
camp let's for service
30 C
that's for service
a 14
15 it's a much better Rhythm on the
return now he really gets to serve back
well
[Applause]
403 Nadal going into the feder forehand
on that serve in the juice box and
feder's keeping a very short swing and
it's coming back with interest
[Applause]
seemed like both players were surprised
that serve wasn't called
out first game second set it's
interesting you mentioned that about
Roger feder's return and the difficulty
the difficulty that Rafa has on being
effective on his own serve at the moment
against SAA he lost just 10 points on
ser
query he reserved superbly
there Nadal struggling on the second
shot in this match like he hasn't in the
others so just small patterns developing
here just one semifinal
loss at the Championships that in 2016
to round it she went ahead and did the
right thing and lost to Murray in the
final
[Applause]
the right play by feder he thought he
had not wrong footed H this Ben here
with the corner of his ey saw that feder
was
approaching and whipped it past
him it's
nor what a sh what was
that that's what we want from the
England team against New Zealand driving
through that back and half
volley quite sure what this one was it
was amazing look at the adjustment that
takes well skill yeah he's just
skillful don't try this at
home that a man with
a white hat and I think the lady with a
straw hat they almost lost the
Bonet as this ball whipped into the
crowd pressure for fedra 30
[Music]
incredible athleticism from both players
Nadal does well to get that crosscourt
federa covering a
[Applause]
net couldn't resist the second passing
shot
doesn't miss those break points
saved juice but all together play
reaches the more Heights the quality
increases B
out
standing get
there second break point and you may not
be able to hear fed's effort on each
ball as he tries to resist these
whipping Nadal for hands but it's there
feder is grunting on each of these fools
juice
Advantage
feder feder eager to get on the front
foot at every opportunity but not easy
to hit winners from behind the
Baseline out
he's being stretched to the Limit now
fed and even if Nadal doesn't get the
break in this game
these these rallies these exchanges
these extended Duce ad contests which
are so compelling to watch
they they wear you
down that's the real
bonus
SS yeah Nadal shows signs of frustration
he always turns around and the
conversation with his
corner on the F of the
for that is a big
[Music]
[Applause]
hold one game more second
ass just a change of Racket Roger fedra
and
you can hardly walk
slower without actually standing still
he's taking a breather here feder as
there for nedb
up huge game early in the second set
there for federa to hold and he'll
immediately want to try and put some
pressure back on the D serve
F lots of success with this aggressive
returns you had statistic in the first
said that's what he didn't do in the
previous matches but obviously he's done
this homework playing each other so many
times you always find a new
way let's for service
15 off
well that's very fine it's elegant it's
delicate it's thoughtful and it's set up
by the returner serve a big first serve
from theal 122
mph straight back at his his feet and
with Nadal
retreating feder plays the drop shot
oh he's put it
right St to have a
match did he have you fool him
ra very last moment he changed Direction
too much on the wrist
[Applause]
though further again with a couple of
break
points I think saved to against his own
serve that's Tim was saying
1
14 Nadal keeps going to that federa
forend in the juice box
and feder still returned that with
interest but Nadal did well to direct
the forehand back
behind still facing another break point
B
juice T more must hurt second of return
or break point you don't get that many
chances like
that make the ball
Advantage
NAD and it's great hitting from both
players amazing how aggressive federa
has been with the backhand going into
Nadal's forehand
game that was the last game of the old
bus and what a hold from break points
down both
players have saved break points in the
last two games brilliant hour in a
quarter here second semi-final here at
wimon 21 theal
second now one of the things that fedra
has taken out on court as a tactic and
Nadal has to figure out here Tim is how
do you stop fedra getting his forehand
into play after his first serve I mean I
don't know where the the D maybe should
stand somewhere different but look here
backand he's only hit one backand after
his first serve so fedra dominating and
getting his forehand into players there
I mean we've been looking at nal's
forehand but how are you going to stop
Roger hitting the shot he wants to hit
well it's very difficult because first
and foremost with with a serve like
fedas that is so accurate has great
disguise you're just trying to get the
ball back into
play having said that you can't just aim
down the middle of the court and hope
feder is going to miss the next one
because his forehand is such a dominant
shot so I think Nadal is going to have
to look at his court position how
aggressive he can be on the return of
serve when he gets that chance would
love to be fly on the wall when liy and
luic spoken to Roger about the match
strategy with cud law about what he
wants to do differently from previous
matches and very much is the return of
serve and the fact that he should
dictate play with his forehand and
that's exactly what he does I think
that's the reason Nadal is in trouble
here having said that he kept on holding
serves now even though he was done break
points important part of the match
especially for Roger thank you ladies
and gentlemen
ready for
play Mr Fedora is challenging the call
on the left Far Side line the balls got
out
team fed has two challenges
remaining let second
service second service Nadal a good 20
ft behind the Baseline
for a second
Serve contact point was 3 m behind the
Baseline for Nadal who continues
particularly on this juice side to give
away the wh serve Tim hen has been
talking about
that points in
two two forand unforced errors from
feder strong point in the middle from
the
D suddenly three break points in a
row let's for service
let's second service
and it's a breaker serve in this
match first break set decided on a tie
break and it's gone to Rafa
Nadal I've seen that a couple times in
the tournament
federa just really played a sloppy game
and the game went very very quickly is
some of that due to the fact that he had
to work so hard to win his previous
service games getting tired don't think
he's getting tired but uh just
momentarily lost
concentration
15 he must look back and and regretting
not taking advantage of the break point
he's had on the Nal Ser early in that
said nice to play catchup
[Applause]
hey suddenly you know we've gone from a
very tight scenario early on in the
second set Nadal wins 10 points in a
row now 3-1 30
love 13 team
taking his time like
always 14
it's become quite one-sided this second
set theal holds and he is strongly in
command in all way here 4-1 and 21
played now this is an era defining
rivalry this Nadal fedra of course jovic
and fedra jovic and Nadal both have
actually played more Grand Slams more
actual matches but this was the Rivalry
that came first and just thinking back
to some of the great sporting rivalries
this has to be up there with any of them
or any Ridder Cup match for me the 1977
duel in the
sun Tom Watson at turnbury Jack Nicholas
the Lakers and Celtics in the NBA I
don't know whether you follow that Boris
I'm sure you sure you do some of the
great boxers over time Watson Ben and
Eubanks here
Haggler Hearns Leonard
Jan Mack Andro Bor wasn't bad Mao
anybody I'd like to put him in the ring
with sugar alen to be quite honest with
you but what what about your sporting
rivalries I mean I think you mentioned
some very good ones you could go down
the football route of you know man
United Liverpool man united Man City
but for me what's very special about
tennis is that it is one against one and
and you mentioned some boxing rivalries
but how often do they actually box when
you look at Novak and Rafa they played
54 times Novak and federa 47 this is
feder Nadal number 40 it's it's
absolutely amazing their longevity their
consistency so Palmer Nicholas player
that was a great rivalry in golf but uh
these are special times in our
sport Boris I want yours in a
minute
15 fer does doesn't want to waste too
much energy here one of the great
golfers of all time nine
majes career Grand Slam car
player that keeps on holding fast
now first time is Ser Vol up to the
second serve I thought he would do that
a lot more actually coming into the
match even though he lost a point I
think it is a good tactic Boris we we
see where Nadal is returning from feder
has plenty of time to get into good
position at the
net 1
let for
service that's your federal taking risks
on the backand he must
can't get involved into too many long
rallies feder's level just
really dropped off in the last 10
minutes now a break point for Nadal to
get the second break of
serve after it looked like a very
contested early second
set came an easy one for Rafael Nadal
now up with a double breaking 51 trying
to level that match set a piece
[Applause]
that was a stabber attack translated
sudden attack by Roger and that a couple
years ago got a lot of
criticism why
[Applause]
not there's more just a little element
of save your energy for the battles
ahead about the last couple of
points game second set and that's the
end of the second set one set all in
this second semifinal in the
Championships we could have I hope we do
have a long way to
go Junior match is taking place in the
second week of the championships as the
crowds dwindle over 40,000 people here
each day the first week somewhere around
there record crowds and the development
of the ground an absolute Delight to see
so many more facilities for
everybody a quick look at the second set
here first serves in at 65%
for Rafa Nadal down a little bit for
federa and Nadal's surf becoming
particularly
effective at 10 but really the battle
was one
be a third of the way through that
set in the men's doubles Kabal and
Farrah are through to play roer
vasala and Nicola mahu who has completed
a career grand
slam the French doubles players are so
interchangeable and their skills so
transferable Pierre ug playing with Andy
maray losing to metic and
skugor the men's double something to
look forward to as is the mixed as well
as we approach finals weekend Serena
Williams going for a record 24th Grand
Slam
title Sera Williams versus Simona halip
at 1 p.m. UK
time on Saturday 1: p.m. on Sunday for
the men's final Novak jovic versus the
winner of this match
time
[Applause]
Rafael Nadal bidding to reach his 27th
Grand Slam final he has won
18 after 26 finals he's been in Roger
fedra has won 20 so these two have won
more of the sports major championships
than any other two Wimbledon for him
ready and eight for the man serving at
one set all Roger fedra
F has to regroup to recapture the form
at the end of that first set and even
beginning of the second
set 30 love first couple of service
games key for him to regain that Rhythm
and establish himself in these
rallies 40 l
[Applause]
first game thir now obviously Roger
feder is just just held there but
Nadal's
changes from set one to set two
particularly on the return points very
interesting indeed Tim Boris have a look
at his average return hit points in set
one first serve a little bit further
back second serve further look what
happens not with the yellow line but
with the blue one in the second set we
noticed it in real life second set
second serve way back and he made every
single return that's a smart adjustment
it is a smart adjustment you see that
distance sort of 4 and A4 meters for the
second server return you wonder
therefore is Federer not been aware
enough to maybe serve and volley a
little bit behind the second serve
because he's so far back but again these
little
mintii of the
match and they vary you know this is a
long match lot of things are
changing players watch each other where
they stand what they do differently all
the
time and it's also so why we don't want
coaching or most people I think it's
fair to say do not want onc Court
coaching like on the women's tour I I
think you're out there alone noticing
these changes and adjusting yourself
without
help s
ly working with fedra for many years
great
friend 18
all one of the reasons the three top
three are so dominant is because of that
but one of the reason the others can't
catch up is because they don't have the
on court coaching so the argument is
made for
both I'm standing on the fence on that
one
[Music]
speaking
of
luic working with Roger feder he's
beaten both of these
guys I bet you never beat
jovic that's
correct never lost to him though did you
[Applause]
th sticking to his routine by driving
through the
return the do seem to have
adjusted G
the one game on thir sets
Mary Joe Fernandez on the right hand
side married to Tony
godik the hend of
Roger 15 love even more so than in the
first set Rogers looking for quick
points should say Mary Joe Fernandez
former world class tennis player playing
in the seniors event here
[Applause]
almost picked off James K in the chair
now if the bar would have bounced back
into rogers's court the ball would have
counted well of the unass yeah it just
didn't if the ball gets out and goes
back it counts really in my book of
rules game
[Applause]
fed well we just have to investigate
that Boris this is the Boris Becker book
of 10 now i' I've seen a lot of books of
tennis and there's been some very good
ones including your own but you've got a
new rule book now if it hits the Net
post and goes in I knew that that
was valid shot but you say if it hits
the it's part of the court it's a it's
it's a fixture it's there all the time
so if you hit James choon and it goes
back into court does that count we can
try that we we have to check the rule
book how about that time I checked you
know my playing days it did
count with a lot of R changes I'm sure
you've had a good look around here Boris
the changes are fantastic Henman Hill
they've left the grass a little bit
longer on the down slopes which is very
smart less
slippery yeah it's been the most popular
spot if you don't have Center qut
ticket feel good atmosphere everybody's
join the sunshine and a p two there's a
couple of bars down there
and people are enjoying themselves at
the end of the week Friday evening this
is the right thing to be doing just down
to the left is where they put some of
the beautiful planting to store before
they plant and both sides of the screen
that number one quarter a living wall
and it's just
gorgeous and I can't remember any of the
names of the
[Music]
pl right one
two 15 l
lets for service
15 off malal staying aggressive close to
the
Baseline he knows if he doesn't hit the
first shot fedra will
13 15
[Applause]
there turning to defense into attack
stepping into that backand and driving
it down the
line although Nadal wasn't at the net
federa treated that shot like a passing
shot
the's forehand down the line would have
got the job done against most he might
have been expecting to see Roger fur up
at the net there fed had backed off and
now has a break point after that CR
caught
foran and break points early in the
second set wasn't able to take them
[Applause]
oh that is rare for Nal to be out DED at
the m
it was actually Nadal that was Keen to
get to the net was not a good drop
volley neither a player able to get on
top until that final volley ladies and
gentlemen
[Music]
love there was a lot of hype a lot of
comparisons with that match 11 years ago
I tell you what we're getting there that
was a 96 mile and a half for
hand the last
one love the team
[Applause]
what a a man of resilience raadal is the
disappointment losing his serve he's
just wiped that away and played two
great
points way back on the second serve
again he's going to get this ball in
play no he's not oh what a surprise
good second serve from federa
15 close to the sideline swinging
[Applause]
away looking to find The Mark with the
first serve here
first double F of the match that hurt an
hour and 45
in it's only
[Applause]
second first of the match ninth of the
tournament doesn't serve many
304 smash was definitely a bit deeper
than feder would expected not always
easy at this time of day with the sun
coming into the stadium
wow well done
boys
unbelievable gasps from the crowd as
ball after ball dips in with top SP it's
the timing it's the footwork it's the
consistency it's how close they hit to
the
lines all at the most important moment
of the
match thank you just knocking in a quick
872 meter sprint there feder a break
point
Down
Still pushes probes and prods an
noise third break point of the game
let's for
service going to need to make this court
bigger if Nadal gets any further
back thanks to for so when he needs it
talked about the onew punch with the
following
forand he looking for the serve volley
here Boris like
to if I were him I would do that
a
what a message point that is for madal
on the 25th shot
Advantage the rally to miss a
[Music]
forehand it's a raer sort of
point a raer point won by Roger
what a game to get out of the Miss on
the second serve return when he had not
30 will disappoint Nadal and so will the
break
points holds for
4-1 games to one that sets one
t I never got an answer about your great
rivalries my
apologies no I'm uh with Tim on that one
that this is an individual Sport and and
team sport as much as I look like the
German English raving football or I'm
into the golf boxing similarities you
know the great Muhammad Ali against
anybody the great Michael Jordan yes his
basketball but the Great Tiger Woods
doties but I think these two players
transcends our sport uh it's more than
just a tennis R we we spoke about about
sport Ries and and these two players are
I will be the most popular Sportsmen
well may I ask you you were with Novak
during some of his greatest
triumphs did he feel unloved compared to
these two well we had discussions about
it and and obviously Novak has millions
of fans himself but then you're talking
about two of the most popular Sportsmen
not just tennis players and it's it's a
very difficult contest and I think by
now he doesn't care so much anymore he
know who he is
but there was a time when it bothered
him
yes time but talking about this contact
is becoming a very physical contact and
that's something Nadal strives for so
I'm not sure how much longer feder can
keep up this 25 30 shot rally but he
does for the
moment for me it was interesting the
reaction of freder when he won that game
you know he doesn't show much emotion
he's pretty cool Cal and collected on
the court but there was a a proper fist
bump up to his box he knew the value of
holding serve having got that
break thank you ladies and gentlemen
love for team
what a bizarre rally gives F love
30 do such as the the the torque coming
through his legs he just lost his
footing just got the ball over Nadal's
head fedra followed it in and now here's
a chance
to close out this set in effect two
breaks would be good enough for
most it seems like fedra has Nadal on
the Run
15 touchy
it's one of the joys of watching sport
you do not know what's going to go on
the amount of talk about this match but
who saw this momentum Shi coming well
it's almost a a complete reverse of the
second
set Nadal was able to get on top there
and run away with it
one feder with these breakpoint
opportunities for the double
break
304 you talked about the message Point
Andrew early on when Roger W that long
rally I think that is bothering natal at
the moment that Roger wins the long
rally not theand as he's used to
to Fabulous points from Nadal and he
will
know that a hole here is set very much
alive still you think it's going to be
easy for fedra to hold
twice to win the set I don't think
so Advantage NAD
[Applause]
[Music]
let's for service
well that tells you what you need to
know about the competitive Spirit of B
thead feder leads by four games to two
having played himself into a winning
position in this set feder has to serve
at 42 he's just the one break ahead very
slim
margin and like Nadal down on the other
end 25 seconds between points Nadal just
getting settled here Cho ofong in the
chair Mr Kong the ire just keeping an
eye on the time
[Music]
well it's another rapper point one by
Roger isn't
it 19 shots this time and it's not easy
with the ball coming in and out of the
shade very bright
in that Southeast corner for
Nadal love we've seen it over and over
again f up dictate getting the first
shot of the rally with his
forehand
49 first point of the game
crucial it has set the tone for the mini
contest that
continued straightforward so far 40 love
[Applause]
[Music]
14 wonder what
he's concerned about up there he's got
all the family up there he's got his
sister his dad in the back with the blue
cat with the Rafer Academy hat on
Francisco Roy on the right hand side
agent Carlos Coster on the left
dad a relatively comfortable hold after
the brutal first
rally playing conditions have changed
here Tim haven't they on Center Court
goodness knows you both have spent time
out there but at this time of the night
now that the roof profile is a little
bit
higher don't get quite so much sun
stretching out quite so long but it is
bad in that particular
corner and that's where the the
players boxes so we've seen a lovely
selection of dark glasses over the years
up there your wife Lucy and friends and
relatives and family Boris all up there
and there's nothing they can do yeah as
a coach a problem because obviously you
want to you know see the match and I
like to watch My Guy play without my
sunglasses I see better but you can't
until the sun is too low and it really
bothers you and then obviously we don't
complain about the good weather right
but I was just going to say you know
here we are at wilon complaining that
it's too
sunny nobody it bothers the players as
well from that side because the sun is
very low especially if you're leftand at
serf you toss up the ball in be St in
the
sun Mera good player
herself supporting Roger and you know I
I'm
watching I'm watching his movement for
fatigue for signs of tness I think
adrenaline is obviously playing a
massive part this is a huge match who
knows how long either of these players
have left after all the injuries that
they you ladies and gentlemen at the age
of what 33 and 37 how old is yep 33
33 the sun is very low into his
eyes but just in the context of this
match the tournament so far Nadal had 9
hours
23 other way around federa 9 hours 23
Nadal 10 hours
45 for those five matches that's not too
much
tennis beautiful sunglasses
to what it starts bothering Nadal that
rer wins to longer Ries you know he's a
proud man he king of Clays every rally
that's longer than five usually hits to
win for the last 15 20 minutes Roger
that's
impossible he's playing
aggressive and playing without mistake
Stakes K
tou 30 off
[Applause]
see
Tony I think he's got one of Rafa's
watches
on 43
[Applause]
fed had L 30 in that game he had great
points in Rafa's previous service game
hasn't taken them Ra's held
so now a real Moment of Truth after a
little over two hours of play in this
semi-final you got Rafa bouncing up and
down never an easy man to serve
to a chance to go two sets to one up
feder oh and it's hit the line and
stopped that's rough
Lu and that's what you want to do just
thinking about that very next
Point Nothing Else
Matters couple of timely first serves
there
love gives him a good platform feder in
an important game
well fed delighted to see Nadal coming
in on a chip that sat there
really but with the four and cross who
did the damage
lets for service
he holds to love under the greatest of
pressure his serve never
challenged on the penultimate service
game a long first point allowed him to
hold but there lots of first serves
brilliant
[Applause]
play and I don't think for a minute that
graa Nadal is is a man to run out of
ideas but he knows he's got to win the
next two sets it's as simple as that
certainly runs off the court no not yet
changing his
sh all those first serves in I mean he's
talked about experience in the past and
it's easy from the outside Tim just to
say oh he's a man of vast experience
it's always going to be something that
that's going to help him and I guess
most of the time it would but he himself
would like to play like an 18-year-old
again and just with that jiv and I I
understand what he's talking about yeah
most definitely I mean we reflect on
these uh stats in the third set again
impressive serving from feder impressive
serving from both players with the
percentage of first of the points W but
the breakpoint opportunities is going to
be key we knew before this match who
would create the chances who would take
them in that third set it was federa
winning one break point but you know
what I mean about expressing himself on
court absolutely and and the reality is
a lot of that is dictated by the
opponent in in the first set it was very
much nip and to there wasn't too much to
show but it was the the second set where
Nadal was really able to express himself
because he got the lead early on and and
uh it was a roll reversal in the third
so I think fourth set of this match it's
who can really get the upper hand early
a lot of people picking Rafa Nadal
before this match Boris Becker because
of the form he had coming in were you
one of them or yeah I was one of them I
thought Rafa looked in fine form and I
always felt that the longer the that's
when the younger player would have an
advantage but little do we know Roger we
talked about playing like an 18y old he
moves like an 18-year-old he's winning
the long
rallies he's really pushing Nadal
physically now which very few men have
ever done maybe besides jovic
nobody so we're just watching this
unfold I think it's still lot of tennis
left
the Championships at the all England
Club just today and the weekend to run
and I'm already beginning to miss it
this time next week so much of it will
have been deconstructed and nobody will
be here and the center cour goes to
sleep once again it really does feel
like a live thing during the
Championships to now this potentially is
a great match at the moment is a very
good one and totally
compelling the pressure is on Nadal now
all of a sudden
love the team
15 all
[Applause]
and they're all those moments when you
want to take advantage of the momentum
you have fedra has the momentum right
now up to Z one he's playing good tennis
he's gotting her down the ropes right
now
well done by the SP
yet he needs to serice game
now to steady the
ship one way of protecting your face
from the Sun I wonder who's under there
that was a second
Sur
heavy kicking 4
they looked happier the last couple
matches they look more relaxed they know
what's at stake
next
game well at 24 years of age Nadal of
course 33 now but back then he was the
youngest to complete the set of all four
grand slam championships the major
sports the major events in tennis he won
the US Open in
2010 both of these BLS have won Olympic
gold medals as well singles and doubles
for rafan adal just doubles for
fedra with Stan
binka just having
some troubles at the moment with his
left
foot I think he called out during that
last game to his box that maybe he needs
a new orthotic sticks in his shoes think
it was his trainer that's gone running
off rafao
go fetch some more shoes from the locker
probably have about
15 15 pairs oh all sorts of people in
there that there's Hugh Grant up there
he plays a bit of tennis any about but
Rod
Le two times he had possession of all
four major championships at the same
time crazy
and a lot of years here when he was
professional but the game wasn't so he
couldn't even play so any debate about
the greatest should include rocket
Rod it's because Nadal standing so far
behind the
Baseline f a lot of time to Val this
time doesn't even have to hit the best
drop shot so the short
one 1
[Applause]
help
[Applause]
has anyone actually checked feder's
passport I mean he's diving around like
young whipper snapper
the footwork is
incredible and the ball would have hit
anybody else's back end he was so fast
over there to hit that forehand and with
his grip to get
underneath find the
angle just lovely
from both players absolutely
Majestic one game over it seems that so
few of the points end in unforced erors
there are so many winners been struck by
both players emphasizing the quality of
the
tennis when you think of sit pass and
verev
and hasanov and others who try to break
into this and others who have failed in
the past good luck
ah
love we did a lot of reflecting on the
2008 final and I would say one shot that
is so much better for federa is the
backand new racket big ah head but wow
is he aggressive today
set getting a lot of pressure on the
now just wondering the's more aggressive
second Serv 101 miles an hour but feder
taking it early driving the back
end rushing Nadal into the era he knows
he wants to get it done in four he
doesn't want to go in five
[Applause]
good
counts are we going to be looking back
at
this shot in a couple of minutes couple
of games or a couple of
sets we'll find
out sorry but not that sorry
that was not a cleanly struck forehand
from Nadal it allow fedra to get his
feet into position plenty of time skip
skip
bang but the damage was again done by
the back and crosscourt opening up the
court look at this
bis drama every time he hits a forehand
both of
them how' you do
that the return was exactly as feder
would have wanted
firm to the back hand it backed Nadal
[Applause]
up he just crunches another winner to
save a break point here's
another let's for service M fed is
challenging a call on the right near
sideline they all scored
he wants to see a second certainly
[Applause]
does
service Mr federa has two challenges
remaining the devil lies in the detail
FS Mr Nadal is challenging a call on the
right near s side line the ball's got
out I like it well umpires are meant to
only overall on a clear mistake well
done James
K not just the players on their game
malal looks down but he knows that ball
was good what a return what a moment
it's a
break and the scoreboard has a
delightful symmetry for federa fans two
sets to one two games to one he closing
in on a famous Victory long way to go
coming over this backand has been great
tactic from feder and his backand Boris
fair to say that it has improved
because of the Ming that Nadal gave it
so many times you thought how is Roger
ever going to resist think forehand very
much so was a real weakness early in his
career you know he had the backand lice
and he could hit over but ultimately
Nadal had the opening there but he
worked on his game he watched tape
strategy with his coach s litle
ultimately realized that the only way
for me to have a chance is to go over
the back hand hit hard step into the
court hit the ball early now that's also
easy talking about it had some great
matches at Wimbledon this year Coco go
has been a big story of course she went
out to palona
herto was a captivating match I thought
Dan Evans and Susu was wonderful to
watch some of the matches perhaps not on
the show courts have been equally
captivating
but this may yet build into a fifth set
but it's going to thank you be up to RFA
madal to change things
let's second service
[Applause]
[Music]
Baseline exchanges that have been won by
federa D is seriously engag with his box
3
love and over and over
again it's fedra wins to rallies
40 low
game
p he's got the ball and his opponent on
a string at the
[Music]
moment fed leads by three games to one
having lost that second set 6-1 the
momentum was entirely with the great
Spaniard fed came
back remember that long 25 stroke rally
it was 63
now 3-1 and this is a free game for
Roger fedra he can go for this he
already has the
break it's a free game for federa but a
must-win game for Nadal
[Applause]
[Applause]
tell you what I expect Nadal to rise
again yeah push F more than he
has Bard is a
champion there a history of coming
back 49
second surf
40 did a curious on that one
that was another great match actually in
its way wasn't it really entertaining
stuff Nadal beating the Australian who
has shown him so much disrespect in his
own
view that was only last week seems like
a month
ago been busy
Boris
that's game
[Music]
[Applause]
leads by three games to two sets one
thing that has changed in the 11 years
since that great match in 2008 I think
is the level of personal respect and
also personal knowledge between these
two obviously their place in the history
of the game
is it's obvious they're right at the top
both of them and always will be in terms
of matches one Wom
fedra 100 matches by beating the
Shori he also leads at the Australian
Open where he's won 97 matches Rafael
Nadal at the French Open 93 matches and
Jimmy Connors at the US Open the last of
the majors he's won 8 so in terms of the
record books we can just go on and
on what a message this will be from
Roger feder if he has a crack no back on
Sunday what a Triumph it would be for a
man who's 38 next
month and in fact these two Tim have won
more matches than anybody else on tour
this year 37 matches
each speaks volum for the work they do
off the
cour F shaking his legs a little bit
serving with new balls thank
you ready for
play 15
low second serve how often do you see
Nadal looking as negative as that I mean
I know that's not much but
irritated
15 time is able to hit it back quite
long and taking a chance on that backand
hitting the line
[Music]
[Music]
this time it's Nadal who
prevails 36 shots
[Applause]
h he is so
cross feder has only made one first
serve in this game
and Nal knows when he gets a look at the
second serve he's got to do a better job
of winning those points
[Applause]
40 feder's body language really hasn't
changed since the first point of the
match oh was it
in
ke he's another step closer to a wimon
final and Rel lead but games to two
offet federa seeded at number two
despite being at world number three
Nadal seated three despite being world
number two irritating for Nadal before
the tournament he was happy to share
that
[Applause]
loveen in terms of
seeding a formula that they use that
takes into account grasscourt
form rather than just going straight off
the ranking
better is the best ever on this
surface having said that he lost last
year in the quarters to Anderson where
Nadal reached the
semi-final losing in five to
jakovich 15
[Applause]
13
[Applause]
that's
amazing he hit that so
hard the ball seem to be too low to do
this
the only way that could be in given all
of the physics
involved is to hit the outside edge so
he
did can say that things are going his
way timely first serve there from the
dark
403 teetering on the brink in this
fourth
set he keeps holding
on wants to keep asking Roger the
ultimate
question let's for service
[Applause]
and Rel leads by four games to three off
sets about two sets to
one talk about the ultimate competitor
and you can pick any of them
really at the top of the game Novak
jovic who awaits in Sunday's final
having beaten Bautista aut fantastic
Spanish effort to get two men into the
semi-finals of the
Championships but either Rafa or or
Roger there's nothing to choose between
the way they compete the spirit of the
two guys
is so strong on the court dominant
personalities both of them
he's qualified for the ATP finals
already which take place in November at
the O2 that's a 15th year for him so
more
tennis in this city later on this
year not overly happy that it's not
played on Clay once in a while played
indoors two more years in London having
that said that he has a history of
injuries usually the end of the year he
takes a week or two even more off his
main focus was will always be this time
of the year winning the French and then
doing well
here it's trying to match be on Bor in
winning the French Wimbledon double for
a third time NAD
the first one with an error and when
you're trying to break back and you're
trying to make any break or serve the
first point is so important and couple
of times it's Nadal that's made those
mistakes it just gives feather of that
platform to build from
what did you say about going his
[Applause]
way he smelt the corner he anticipated
1 but one thing Nadal will always do
fight until the end it doesn't matter
the score line it doesn't matter the
[Applause]
opponent the accuracy
14 of that serve from feder is just
phenomenal time and time again finding
the center service line
[Applause]
leads by five games to three set Boris
you're impressed by Roger body language
unbelievable I haven't seen him Focus
like this in a long time maybe the last
time he won a
major was 18 months
ago Australian
Open five sets against this
man let's for service
that might be the only time when the Dal
turns it in he said if that goes in I'm
off not taking any prisoners today
[Applause]
15 if fedra had a kitchen sink right now
he would be throwing that as well
correction and fedra is doing the right
thing by aiding James Kong there he's
walking he knows full well that that Mis
call did not affect in any way his
return just move on
[Music]
thank you
unusual looking back from gra and adal
there
stretched it's almost the one-handed Top
Spin backand from the
do see the way Rogers hit his and maybe
fany's a one
handed oh did he need to play
that 403 now copying the one-handed Top
Spin back and he thought I might as well
start serving and volleying first time
in the
match expect the unexpected
that's good it's better than good I mean
him it's
fabulous and again no emotion nothing
Welling keeps it all
[Applause]
[Music]
together Mr oh challenged on the service
line the B got in ah it's funny cuz if
he's wrong and he's smiling with rapper
it was actually a perfect
return oh wow and if he hadn't
challenged he'd be match point I know oh
Mr fed has one challenge
remaining boy hopefully it's not going
to hunt thank you a great twist
please that's a first
it would have it could have it should
have
M I think fedus should have just lost
that point so that psychologically he
said look oh I wouldn't have won the
game
anyway
amazing back to
juice still two points from
Victory and now he does have a match
point
another early strike off the Nadal
serve and this 40th meeting between
these two great
Champions well they may be one point to
play no no
got a whole set and a half to go from
[Applause]
here that match point was at 729 just in
case we have to come back to
it Advantage another
Ace
up game point
[Applause]
when the last match here 11 years ago
there was a match point in the fourth
set as well it went to five just
saying let for service
[Applause]
juice that weakness is looking mighty
strong his backhand has been phenomenal
today federa
it's well handled from fedra the ball
hit the line and stopped he was able
to just half check on the back hand got
it back into play it's a second match
point
defend it
again yes
off
Nadal simply Unleashed a back
hand to get the opportunity to move
forward on the forehand and that's as
much to Roger fedra as it is to his
Camp two match points save Nal holds
thedra will serve for
it two
sets this is uh very unfortunate for
madal who's undoing the taping we
thought that he might have a problem
with
his his shoes maybe some Orthotics he's
probably got six or seven pairs on
rotation tennis players feet are really
not as beautiful as the game they play
and he plays without tape now which is
unusual he has a lot of injury problems
in the
past want to tape their ankle just for a
double protection he takes it off and
also it's going to take a little bit of
time and Nadal's not exactly quick
between games and feder is coming out to
serve 54 fourth
set and Nadal is still putting his shoes
on the Moment of Truth serving for the
match well to his credit Nadal is not
taking a medical or anything seen plenty
of players do so in situations that
don't need it
conversation with the Umpire
[Applause]
though all right here we
go unfolding in front of our
eyes Nadal still fiddling with his laces
there feder's backed off he's come up to
the Baseline he's looked away
and if feder is a little bit cross with
that you wouldn't know
ital has challenged the ball on the left
near side line the ball's good
in everyone's pretty tight right now
love Mr Nadal has one challenge
remaining
15
on still a long way to go
[Music]
incredible
hitting at this stage of the
match to maintain the timing on those
virtual half
fies incredible
long Mr fed is challenging the ball on
the left basine the ball scor
[Applause]

yep Mr federa has no more challenges
remaining
oh no challenges remaining thank
you let's for
[Applause]
service a oh I don't think I've seen him
missing
[Music]
overhead this
decade but it was the forehand that
should have gone away that one just got
low popped over the
Baseline thank you Nadal made him play a
tough ball players are ready thank you
oh the ler
time and again as the rallies have
extended even in the most
precious and difficult moments it's fer
that's come out on

Le the first volley was beautifully
executed the
second
Sublime and
Roger stays calm no
[Applause]

nature isn't he Nadal look at this W

he won't need
them SP Mr Nadal has point on his own

talk about bringing out the best in each
other just when we thought it doesn't
get any
better they're lifting each other
[Applause]
Spirits White
pleas feder has gone up the tea with the
last couple of first serves
oh he hit that
well it was a mishit return once again
Federal's footwork
magnificent can madal find the answer
again
[Music]
[Applause]
no a little
early that's away what a contest Roger
Pedra 37 years of age he's into his 12th
Wimbledon final
unbelievable says David be quite right
it is unbelievable to watch them
together
the patterns of play Are So Beautiful to
the
eye and these two magnificent
Champions and even now rapper has time
to sign autograph so this is not
uncommon it's not for the cameras this
is just who he is and that's another
reason why the sport has been so lucky
to have them both now rafan Nadal has
just won his 12 French
Open so it's difficult to feel terribly
sorry for either of these celebrated and
endorsed athletes
but a tough match to lose but a glorious
contest Boris you enjoy that very much
so uh f walking off he's still shaking
his head sort of smiling with himself he
can't believe how he play that's the
best I've seen him in a long time and
and you the other day Rafa
said he didn't lose the match the
opponent won it and I think that's what
rer did today
